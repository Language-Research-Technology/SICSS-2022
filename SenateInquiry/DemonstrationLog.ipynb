It is primarily an agricultural shire however the extraction of nickel, cobalt\nand scandium is an emerging industry that could create hundreds of jobs locally through\nmining and processing of the raw materials.\nThe main towns are Condobolin (pop: 3,500) and Lake Cargelligo (pop: 1,800) sited some\n100kms apart. The nearest regional cities to Condobolin are Dubbo and Orange some\n200kms away. The nearest regional city to Lake Cargelligo is Griffith 134kms distant.\nI have sought comments from staff of the Council and these are as follows;\n1. Declining access to face to face services such as banks, insurers, health funds, etc\n– This is particularly difficult for the elderly or people who don’t have access to\nonline services such as those who live a long way out of town where there is\nlimited/no internet access. Reasoning is that branches are expensive to keep open\n&amp; declining country towns are a tiny fraction of their market. Hence the rise of local\ncredit unions &amp; community banks – this doesn’t help people who have a long term\nrelationship with one of the larger banks who have reduced their opening hours\nthough.\n2. Poor access to health services – there is no children’s ward at our hospital &amp; you\ncan’t have a baby delivered in this shire (a pregnant specialist doctor would not\nrelocate to Condobolin because she would have to travel 100kms to the nearest\nhospital at Parkes to have the baby delivered). The Ochre Health Medical Centre in\nCondobolin is a revolving door of mostly overseas doctors and patients lose that\ncontinuity of care that they can get in metropolitan centres. To see a specialist often\ninvolves a 400km round trip to Orange or Dubbo and overnight accommodation in\nmany cases.\nLachlan Shire Council\n\n\nThe Heart of NSW\n\n3. Lack of shopping facilities like a basic department store with a variety of clothing.\n“People can’t buy underwear for example anywhere in town except the IGA, and\nthey don’t sell bras. It’s a wonder how elderly/disabled people who no longer have a\ndriver’s licence clothe themselves.” “Low cost clothing/housing items found in stores\nsuch as Target, Kmart, Best and Less, Big W, etc will not establish in towns under\n10,000 population. If a school concert is coming up and you need certain clothing\nfor the children you have to travel to Parkes, something as simple as a red shirt you\nhave to make a 2 hour trip. I had to travel away to buy paints and a canvas for\nartwork. I had to travel to Parkes to repair my TV, leave it there and pick it up two\nweeks later. Beauty products, home items, entertainment I had to learn to buy\nonline. I’m sure there are many other services that are not provided here”. “My wife\ncites the one biggest downfall of Condobolin as having a lack of shops for women.\nShe was shocked not to see at least one Target, Big W, Kmart or Best and Less. It\nhas swayed her opinion of the town (which she otherwise loves).\n4. Lack of amusement activities for youth. We have a small volunteer theatre group\nthat runs one movie a month &amp; it isn’t necessarily a kid’s movie. Council has\nrecently constructed two adventure playgrounds and two skate parks at both main\ntowns as well as spending over $150k per annum on youth programs however the\nyouth centres are inadequate in size and children are not engaged. It is noted\nhowever there is also the Lachlan River, Gumbend Lake and Lake Cargelligo that\nprovide boating, swimming and fishing activities. Council also provides and\nmaintains four separate swimming centres within the shire at a cost of over\n$800,000 per annum however they are only open during the warmer months as\nCouncil cannot afford to enclose and heat the pools due to the associated running\ncosts and small rate revenue base.\n5. “Entertainment for families on a weekend is minimal, no cinemas, ten pin bowling,\nwater parks, shopping centres, café to go and eat (after 12pm).”\n6. “Cultural stimulation especially for educational purposes isn’t the greatest. There is\nnothing here for the children to see - art, museums, a tourist centre to run cultural\ntours or cultural educational talks (We have a high Aboriginal Population and no\none’s taking advantage of that?). “\n7. Sport - “We only have certain options and only during the season the sport is played\ne.g basketball isn’t played here in Condobolin, netball is only played during winter.\nChildren who get selected for representative sport usually have to travel great\ndistances with additional accommodation and transport costs. For children who are\ntalented, parents would have to spend money and time away from work to assist in\nLachlan Shire Council\n\n\nThe Heart of NSW\n\ntheir development. It wouldn’t be possible for parents who cannot afford to do that\nat all and the children suffer. It would also be a cause of families moving away to\nlarger regional centres”. Declining population (particularly youth) also means it is\ndifficult to run well patronised sporting competitions because you can’t raise enough\nteams to participate.\n8. Access to Trades – Limited access to qualified and experienced trades ie\nplumbers, electricians, builders, para-professional and professional staff and\ncontractors. For example, difficulties in recruiting for water plant operators and\nobtaining competitive tenders/quotes for simple construction jobs like Rural Fire\nService sheds which can be located remotely.\n9. Mobile Telephone Reception – “Between major towns such as Condobolin, Parkes,\nOrange, Bathurst, Dubbo, Lake Cargelligo, etc the mobile phone reception is very\npatchy. How do they expect to turn this area into a major food bowl if farmers and\nother businessmen can’t even do business on the phone whilst driving”. Lack of\ninternet access and/or data speed in many areas can impact on the ability to create\njobs (people who could work from home remotely) and study opportunities for those\nin remote areas,\n10. “Cafés close early, so simple take away food for dinner options is only at the service\nstations. There is only 1 Chinese restaurant in Condobolin and the other options are\nthe motor inn and pubs. Cost of groceries is high, assuming it’s more expensive\nhere because of the transport to deliver to regional towns? Fresh fruit and\nvegetables are sometimes questionable!”\n11. TAFE NSW in Condobolin and Lake Cargelligo have very limited hours of business\nand limited choices in training which impacts younger community members wanting\nto study a trade. “Training and upskilling of employees is either online or travel out\nof town. Seems as if TAFE does not run the appropriate courses here and teachers\nare not available in Condobolin to visit the employee for RPL. Also no private\ncolleges/schools close by to send children. Education and training is poor in this\ntown, another reason why families would move away or send their children away to\nattend private schools/universities. There is no real opportunity to upskill individuals\nand then utilise those skills locally in Condobolin, no real development of the local\neconomy. If you really want to build a successful career you need to leave the\ntown.”\n12. No access to a Taxi Service or local bus route in the towns makes it difficult for\npeople without a vehicle to do shopping or go anywhere for recreation.\nLachlan Shire Council\n\n\nThe Heart of NSW\n\n13. Travel required applying for a Tax File No (Local Australia Post offices not equipped\nto process these applications).\n14. Cost of building new houses is greater due to the lack of competition among\nbuilders and distance from suppliers. People risk over capitalising if they build a\nnew home. “Housing is poor. The development of new housing is non-existent.\nDon’t bother looking for a modern home - all you would get is old run down houses.\nIt seems if people need somewhere good to live they need to know people, or look\nat buy swap and sell on Facebook rather than go through the real-estate agents”.\n15. The quality of roads in regional areas make transport and travel more difficult with\nunsealed roads damaging vehicles or forcing people to purchase more expensive\ncars such as four wheel drives. Just going overseas means an hours’ drive to\nParkes airport then to Sydney to link with an international plane – this often means\nadditional travel costs, overnight stays in Parkes and/or Sydney and additional\nannual leave needing to be taken.\nThe reasons regional towns struggle varies between towns but often include:\n\n\ndistance and lack of public transport like affordable air travel\n\n\n\nmechanisation and technology advances in agriculture reducing employment\nopportunities\n\n\n\nlack of diversified industries leading to fewer job opportunities for young people to\nmake a career and so they move away to larger centres\n\n\n\nglobalisation of the economy and an increase in online services and provision of\nproducts – impacts local businesses and hence employment\n\n\n\nloss of human capital from towns as government and private services are\ndownsized or closed &amp; people move away – there are less well educated\nprofessionals like public servants/bank managers etc – those people who once\nwere the backbone of the local clubs and service organisations like the chamber of\ncommerce etc and who are prepared to think outside the square to maintain or\nrevitalise a town’s economy;\n\n\n\nageing infrastructure – for example water and sewer treatment plants make it\ndifficult for towns to support major industry or new industries. Cost of these\nservices is also greater for rural residents as there are fewer people to share the\nburden of expensive new infrastructure\nLachlan Shire Council\n\n\nThe Heart of NSW\n\nRural towns which are growing usually have some sort of hook to get people there. It might\nbe tourism generated by some festivals and events (that’s where human capital is required\nto get those things happening), or some geographical uniqueness, or a special industry\nsuch as wine production, mining, government agency headquarters, new prison, located\non a national highway, army base, etc.\nTowns that are in decline need to find ways to attract new residents and this can be done\nthrough a number of ways;\n\n\nGovernment Incentives for new light industries and larger retail chains to locate in\nregions such as better tax incentives, relocation subsidies, training of staff, reduced\nincome tax for employees in remote areas to attract skilled people, provision of\nenabling infrastructure, develop trade policies with other countries or impose tariffs\nand better transport links to ports/markets.\n\n\n\nBeautifying Central Business Districts to attract businesses and shoppers – through\nincreased grants to Councils.\n\n\n\nProviding facilities comparable to larger centres such as playgrounds, all year\nswimming centres, indoor sport stadiums, sporting amenities, child care centres,\netc through reallocation of Commonwealth Financial Assistance Grants from\ncity/metropolitan areas to non-coastal rural areas.\n\n\n\nGovernment subsidies to drought proof towns in low rainfall areas through new\ninfrastructure such as water treatment plants, bores, pumps and pipelines. This\nwould help in beautifying towns, reduce the cost of water and attract new residents\nand businesses.\n\n\n\nIncrease Roads to Recovery grants for rural areas to improve road transport\ncorridors, enhance safety, reduce wear and tear on vehicles and reduce time taken\nto get anywhere.\n\n\n\nCreate new tourist attractions and events to increase visitation – these again need\ngovernment support to help fund them.\n\n\n\nIncrease incentives for skilled health staff to locate in rural areas, upgrade old\nhospitals so that staff can work in modern facilities, reduce medicare levy for\nrural/remote workers whose families have to travel long distances for health care.\n\n\n\nConstruct affordable housing that is modern and replace old dilapidated housing\nwith new.\nLachlan Shire Council\n\n\nThe Heart of NSW\n\n\n\nFund new mobile phone towers to cover black spots, increase safety for travellers\nand allow business over the phone (hands free) while travelling long and boring\ndistances.\n\n\n\nEnsure adequate internet access and data download speed for people to complete\nhome study, work from home and for farmers/businesses.\n\n\n\nSubsidise TAFE training and increase subsidies for trade apprentices – we won’t\nget the required minimum numbers in each subject so subsidies need to paid to the\ntraining organisation.\n\n\n\nExpand FBT concessions and what can be salary sacrificed to attract and retain\nskilled employees to rural areas.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to make a submission.

              "1 \\nThe Heart of NSW\\n\\nContact Person:\\nReference No:\\n\\nRobert Hunt\\n\\nRe: Inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia\\nLachlan Shire Council comprises some 6,400 residents spread over 15,000 sq. kms in\\nCentral NSW. It is primarily an agricultural shire however the extraction of nickel, cobalt\\nand scandium is an emerging industry that could create hundreds of jobs locally through\\nmining and processing of the raw materials.\\nThe main towns are Condobolin (pop: 3,500) and Lake Cargelligo (pop: 1,800) sited some\\n100kms apart. The nearest regional cities to Condobolin are Dubbo and Orange some\\n200kms away. The nearest regional city to Lake Cargelligo is Griffith 134kms distant.\\nI have sought comments from staff of the Council and these are as follows;\\n1. Declining access to face to face services such as banks, insurers, health funds, etc\\n– This is particularly difficult for the elderly or people who don’t have access to\\nonline services such as those who live a long way out of town where there is\\nlimited/no internet access. Reasoning is that branches are expensive to keep open\\n& declining country towns are a tiny fraction of their market. Hence the rise of local\\ncredit unions & community banks – this doesn’t help people who have a long term\\nrelationship with one of the larger banks who have reduced their opening hours\\nthough.\\n2. Poor access to health services – there is no children’s ward at our hospital & you\\ncan’t have a baby delivered in this shire (a pregnant specialist doctor would not\\nrelocate to Condobolin because she would have to travel 100kms to the nearest\\nhospital at Parkes to have the baby delivered). The Ochre Health Medical Centre in\\nCondobolin is a revolving door of mostly overseas doctors and patients lose that\\ncontinuity of care that they can get in metropolitan centres. To see a specialist often\\ninvolves a 400km round trip to Orange or Dubbo and overnight accommodation in\\nmany cases.\\nLachlan Shire Council\\n\\n\\nThe Heart of NSW\\n\\n3. Lack of shopping facilities like a basic department store with a variety of clothing.\\n“People can’t buy underwear for example anywhere in town except the IGA, and\\nthey don’t sell bras. It’s a wonder how elderly/disabled people who no longer have a\\ndriver’s licence clothe themselves.” “Low cost clothing/housing items found in stores\\nsuch as Target, Kmart, Best and Less, Big W, etc will not establish in towns under\\n10,000 population. If a school concert is coming up and you need certain clothing\\nfor the children you have to travel to Parkes, something as simple as a red shirt you\\nhave to make a 2 hour trip. I had to travel away to buy paints and a canvas for\\nartwork. I had to travel to Parkes to repair my TV, leave it there and pick it up two\\nweeks later. Beauty products, home items, entertainment I had to learn to buy\\nonline. I’m sure there are many other services that are not provided here”. “My wife\\ncites the one biggest downfall of Condobolin as having a lack of shops for women.\\nShe was shocked not to see at least one Target, Big W, Kmart or Best and Less. It\\nhas swayed her opinion of the town (which she otherwise loves).\\n4. Lack of amusement activities for youth. We have a small volunteer theatre group\\nthat runs one movie a month & it isn’t necessarily a kid’s movie. Council has\\nrecently constructed two adventure playgrounds and two skate parks at both main\\ntowns as well as spending over $150k per annum on youth programs however the\\nyouth centres are inadequate in size and children are not engaged. It is noted\\nhowever there is also the Lachlan River, Gumbend Lake and Lake Cargelligo that\\nprovide boating, swimming and fishing activities. Council also provides and\\nmaintains four separate swimming centres within the shire at a cost of over\\n$800,000 per annum however they are only open during the warmer months as\\nCouncil cannot afford to enclose and heat the pools due to the associated running\\ncosts and small rate revenue base.\\n5. “Entertainment for families on a weekend is minimal, no cinemas, ten pin bowling,\\nwater parks, shopping centres, café to go and eat (after 12pm).”\\n6. “Cultural stimulation especially for educational purposes isn’t the greatest. There is\\nnothing here for the children to see - art, museums, a tourist centre to run cultural\\ntours or cultural educational talks (We have a high Aboriginal Population and no\\none’s taking advantage of that?). “\\n7. Sport - “We only have certain options and only during the season the sport is played\\ne.g basketball isn’t played here in Condobolin, netball is only played during winter.\\nChildren who get selected for representative sport usually have to travel great\\ndistances with additional accommodation and transport costs. For children who are\\ntalented, parents would have to spend money and time away from work to assist in\\nLachlan Shire Council\\n\\n\\nThe Heart of NSW\\n\\ntheir development. It wouldn’t be possible for parents who cannot afford to do that\\nat all and the children suffer. It would also be a cause of families moving away to\\nlarger regional centres”. Declining population (particularly youth) also means it is\\ndifficult to run well patronised sporting competitions because you can’t raise enough\\nteams to participate.\\n8. Access to Trades – Limited access to qualified and experienced trades ie\\nplumbers, electricians, builders, para-professional and professional staff and\\ncontractors. For example, difficulties in recruiting for water plant operators and\\nobtaining competitive tenders/quotes for simple construction jobs like Rural Fire\\nService sheds which can be located remotely.\\n9. Mobile Telephone Reception – “Between major towns such as Condobolin, Parkes,\\nOrange, Bathurst, Dubbo, Lake Cargelligo, etc the mobile phone reception is very\\npatchy. How do they expect to turn this area into a major food bowl if farmers and\\nother businessmen can’t even do business on the phone whilst driving”. Lack of\\ninternet access and/or data speed in many areas can impact on the ability to create\\njobs (people who could work from home remotely) and study opportunities for those\\nin remote areas,\\n10. “Cafés close early, so simple take away food for dinner options is only at the service\\nstations. There is only 1 Chinese restaurant in Condobolin and the other options are\\nthe motor inn and pubs. Cost of groceries is high, assuming it’s more expensive\\nhere because of the transport to deliver to regional towns? Fresh fruit and\\nvegetables are sometimes questionable!”\\n11. TAFE NSW in Condobolin and Lake Cargelligo have very limited hours of business\\nand limited choices in training which impacts younger community members wanting\\nto study a trade. “Training and upskilling of employees is either online or travel out\\nof town. Seems as if TAFE does not run the appropriate courses here and teachers\\nare not available in Condobolin to visit the employee for RPL. Also no private\\ncolleges/schools close by to send children. Education and training is poor in this\\ntown, another reason why families would move away or send their children away to\\nattend private schools/universities. There is no real opportunity to upskill individuals\\nand then utilise those skills locally in Condobolin, no real development of the local\\neconomy. If you really want to build a successful career you need to leave the\\ntown.”\\n12. No access to a Taxi Service or local bus route in the towns makes it difficult for\\npeople without a vehicle to do shopping or go anywhere for recreation.\\nLachlan Shire Council\\n\\n\\nThe Heart of NSW\\n\\n13. Travel required applying for a Tax File No (Local Australia Post offices not equipped\\nto process these applications).\\n14. Cost of building new houses is greater due to the lack of competition among\\nbuilders and distance from suppliers. People risk over capitalising if they build a\\nnew home. “Housing is poor. The development of new housing is non-existent.\\nDon’t bother looking for a modern home - all you would get is old run down houses.\\nIt seems if people need somewhere good to live they need to know people, or look\\nat buy swap and sell on Facebook rather than go through the real-estate agents”.\\n15. The quality of roads in regional areas make transport and travel more difficult with\\nunsealed roads damaging vehicles or forcing people to purchase more expensive\\ncars such as four wheel drives. Just going overseas means an hours’ drive to\\nParkes airport then to Sydney to link with an international plane – this often means\\nadditional travel costs, overnight stays in Parkes and/or Sydney and additional\\nannual leave needing to be taken.\\nThe reasons regional towns struggle varies between towns but often include:\\n\\n\\ndistance and lack of public transport like affordable air travel\\n\\n\\n\\nmechanisation and technology advances in agriculture reducing employment\\nopportunities\\n\\n\\n\\nlack of diversified industries leading to fewer job opportunities for young people to\\nmake a career and so they move away to larger centres\\n\\n\\n\\nglobalisation of the economy and an increase in online services and provision of\\nproducts – impacts local businesses and hence employment\\n\\n\\n\\nloss of human capital from towns as government and private services are\\ndownsized or closed & people move away – there are less well educated\\nprofessionals like public servants/bank managers etc – those people who once\\nwere the backbone of the local clubs and service organisations like the chamber of\\ncommerce etc and who are prepared to think outside the square to maintain or\\nrevitalise a town’s economy;\\n\\n\\n\\nageing infrastructure – for example water and sewer treatment plants make it\\ndifficult for towns to support major industry or new industries. Cost of these\\nservices is also greater for rural residents as there are fewer people to share the\\nburden of expensive new infrastructure\\nLachlan Shire Council\\n\\n\\nThe Heart of NSW\\n\\nRural towns which are growing usually have some sort of hook to get people there. It might\\nbe tourism generated by some festivals and events (that’s where human capital is required\\nto get those things happening), or some geographical uniqueness, or a special industry\\nsuch as wine production, mining, government agency headquarters, new prison, located\\non a national highway, army base, etc.\\nTowns that are in decline need to find ways to attract new residents and this can be done\\nthrough a number of ways;\\n\\n\\nGovernment Incentives for new light industries and larger retail chains to locate in\\nregions such as better tax incentives, relocation subsidies, training of staff, reduced\\nincome tax for employees in remote areas to attract skilled people, provision of\\nenabling infrastructure, develop trade policies with other countries or impose tariffs\\nand better transport links to ports/markets.\\n\\n\\n\\nBeautifying Central Business Districts to attract businesses and shoppers – through\\nincreased grants to Councils.\\n\\n\\n\\nProviding facilities comparable to larger centres such as playgrounds, all year\\nswimming centres, indoor sport stadiums, sporting amenities, child care centres,\\netc through reallocation of Commonwealth Financial Assistance Grants from\\ncity/metropolitan areas to non-coastal rural areas.\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernment subsidies to drought proof towns in low rainfall areas through new\\ninfrastructure such as water treatment plants, bores, pumps and pipelines. This\\nwould help in beautifying towns, reduce the cost of water and attract new residents\\nand businesses.\\n\\n\\n\\nIncrease Roads to Recovery grants for rural areas to improve road transport\\ncorridors, enhance safety, reduce wear and tear on vehicles and reduce time taken\\nto get anywhere.\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate new tourist attractions and events to increase visitation – these again need\\ngovernment support to help fund them.\\n\\n\\n\\nIncrease incentives for skilled health staff to locate in rural areas, upgrade old\\nhospitals so that staff can work in modern facilities, reduce medicare levy for\\nrural/remote workers whose families have to travel long distances for health care.\\n\\n\\n\\nConstruct affordable housing that is modern and replace old dilapidated housing\\nwith new.\\nLachlan Shire Council\\n\\n\\nThe Heart of NSW\\n\\n\\n\\nFund new mobile phone towers to cover black spots, increase safety for travellers\\nand allow business over the phone (hands free) while travelling long and boring\\ndistances.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnsure adequate internet access and data download speed for people to complete\\nhome study, work from home and for farmers/businesses.\\n\\n\\n\\nSubsidise TAFE training and increase subsidies for trade apprentices – we won’t\\nget the required minimum numbers in each subject so subsidies need to paid to the\\ntraining organisation.\\n\\n\\n\\nExpand FBT concessions and what can be salary sacrificed to attract and retain\\nskilled employees to rural areas.\\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to make a submission.
