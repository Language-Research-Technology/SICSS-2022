Inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia
Dear Committee Members,
Thank you for the opportunity to provide input to the Committee’s inquiry into the indicators of, and
impact of, regional inequality in Australia. The Royal Flying Doctors Service (RFDS) is a vital part of
remote and rural communities, providing critical health services to areas of great need, particularly in
places where low population numbers make it unviable to support local health services such as
hospitals, emergency departments, pharmacies and General Practitioners (GPs).
Research shows that health services such as those provided by the RFDS are needed now more than
ever, with persistent health workforce shortages and challenges in accessing comprehensive health
services leading to poorer health outcomes for those living in remote and rural areas of Australia.
There is not the same access to comprehensive health services in remote and rural Australia as in
other areas of Australia, there is a significant disparity, and as a consequence there are critical
disparities in the health outcomes of country Australians. Drawing on research published by the RFDS
Research and Policy Unit, it is from this perspective that the RFDS makes a contribution to this inquiry,
focusing on the inequality in health and healthcare in remote and rural areas as compared to
metropolitan parts of Australia, and outlined in this submission.
The 2017 RFDS report Health care access, mental health, and preventative health: health priority
survey findings for people in the bush, presents evidence that the seven million Australians living in
remote and rural areas have poorer health outcomes and live shorter lives than city residents. There is
a lower life expectancy and higher levels of premature mortality, morbidity, and health and disease
risk factors. For example, the percentage of people in remote areas with arthritis, asthma, deafness,
diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease are all higher than in cities. And the health behaviours of
people in country areas are less conducive to good health than people in cities, with higher rates of
smoking, obesity, and alcohol misuse in remote areas than in cities. This research is further detailed in
an excerpt from this report at Attachment A.
The 2017 RFDS report outlined above, builds on the 2015 report by the Centre for International
Economic (CIE), Flexible and responsive primary healthcare in rural and remote Australia, which found
that Australians in remote and rural areas see doctors at only half the rate of metropolitan Australians;
they see medical specialists at a third of the rate; and, they access mental health care at only one fifth
the rate. Given this disparity in access, it comes as no surprise that the CIE also found death rates in
remote and outer regional areas are 35% higher than in metropolitan areas and that life expectancy
for remote and rural residents is at least 2.2 years less than for metropolitan residents.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 64

Other RFDS research papers on specific health topics similarly demonstrate critical inequalities in
health outcomes and access to health services for those living in remote and rural areas. For example,
the 2017 paper Cardiovascular health in remote and rural communities shows that between July 2013
and December 2016, the RFDS conducted 20,379 emergency aeromedical transfers – 16 per day – in
response to cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most common reason for a transport, at 21.3%. This is a
consequence of adults living in remote and rural communities, along with Indigenous Australians,
adults living in the lowest socioeconomic areas, and people from culturally and linguistically diverse
backgrounds being at increased risk of CVD. Further, rates of CVD are shown to be highest in inner
regional areas (25%), followed by outer regional and remote areas (22%).
People living in remote and rural Australia are more exposed than city people to CVD risk behaviours,
including higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, high blood pressure and low physical
activity, as well as poorer diets. The report further discusses the impact of place of residence as an
important determinant of cardiovascular health, with people living in remote and rural Australia
experiencing poorer cardiovascular health than people living in major cities (Tideman et al., 2013).
Poorer access to services, and variation in implementation of evidence-based CVD care across
geographic boundaries, may contribute to poorer cardiovascular heath in remote and rural Australia.
Specifically, remote and rural areas have fewer health professionals, reduced health infrastructure and
higher costs of health care delivery (Tideman et al., 2013).

Meanwhile, the 2017 report Mental Health in Rural and Remote Communities outlines alarming
evidence that rates of suicide and self-harm are significantly higher in remote and rural areas, with
residents of very remote areas twice as likely to die from suicide as city residents. A number of factors
are shown exacerbate mental health acuity in remote and rural Australia, including: poor access to
primary and acute care; limited numbers of mental health services and mental health professionals;
reluctance to seek help; concerns about stigma; distance to and cost of services; and, cultural barriers
in service access. There is a limited supply of specialist mental health professionals, with significantly
fewer psychiatrists, psychologists and mental health nurses per head of population in remote and
rural areas. Indeed, as shown in Figure 2, many parts of remote Australia - 201 local government areas
– have no registered practicing psychologists.
Figure 2.

Our 2016 report, Responding to Injury in Remote and Rural Australia, found that people living in
remote and rural areas are around twice as likely to die from, or be hospitalised, for an injury than
people living in major cities. In particular, the key causes for these injuries include those arising from
transportation, drowning, poisoning, falls, burns, assault and self-harm. In fact, across almost every
category of non-intentional and intentional injuries, incidence rates and associated death and
morbidity are higher in remote and rural areas than in metropolitan areas of Australia, with the rates
of hospitalisations and deaths resulting from injuries increasing with increasing remoteness - the injury
death rate for residents of remote Australia was 1.8 times the injury death rate of residents of major
cities; while the rates of hospitalisation in response to an injury for residents of very remote areas
were 2.2 times higher than for residents of major cities.
Similarly, our 2015 report Filling the Gap: Disparities in oral health access and outcomes demonstrated
that access specifically to oral health services becomes more difficult with increasing remoteness, and
the oral health of people in these areas are consequently much poorer. It was found, for example, that
childhood cavities are 55% higher for remote area children than for children in major cities; that the
number of filled teeth in remote area children is double that of city children; that 63% of adults in
3

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 64

major city adults visited a dentist in a year, compared to only 45% of
people in remote areas; and that major cities have three times as many
working dentists than country areas, with 72 dentists for every 100,000 people in cities compared to
only 22 for every 100,000 people in the country.
The significant disparity in health outcomes experienced by country Australians as compared to their
city counterparts, due in a large part to difficulty in accessing comprehensive health services, has a
considerable impact on the vitality, productivity and sustainability of rural and remote communities.
As a matter of priority, the maldistribution of the health workforce between city and country areas
must be rectified.
The RFDS acknowledges previous policy efforts of both Commonwealth and state and territory
governments, and the challenges of seeking to ensure the delivery of comprehensive services to the
small populations that live across very large geographic areas in rural and remote Australia. These
small populations often do not provide a viable business model to sustain a comprehensive health
workforce locally, but rather health needs must be met through innovative and flexible service
delivery models, such as the fly-in fly-out services of the RFDS, and appropriate, effective use of
technologies that must be supported by improved infrastructure to ensure affordability. Further, longterm policy initiatives and investment are required, acknowledging that the remote and rural health
workforce and their patients are more detrimentally impacted by funding uncertainty owing
particularly to the challenges in recruiting health professionals to these areas.
We would be keen to discuss matters raised in this submission with the Committee, and how the RFDS
can further contribute to inquiry. Please contact me

to arrange a

1.2 Background
It is evident that Australia’s remote and rural areas differ significantly in their location, economic
activities, climate and demography (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2010).
Consequently, health status may vary within each of the broad remoteness categories (Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare, 2010). However, the evidence indicates that as a whole, remote
and rural Australians generally experience poorer health than people living in major cities,
including higher levels of mortality, morbidity, and health and disease risk factors (Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008, 2014, 2016a).
Australians living in remote and rural areas have a lower life expectancy than people living in
major cities and are more likely to die prematurely. Although only around 29% of people live in
remote and rural areas, deaths in these areas accounted for 38% of premature deaths in
2011–2013— the premature mortality rate among people living in remote areas was 1.6 times
higher, and in very remote areas 2.2 times higher, than people living in major cities (Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare, 2016a). In 2009–2011 mortality rates of remote and very remote
Australians were 1.4 times higher than people living in major cities (Australian Institute of Health
and Welfare, 2016a).
Self-reported data from the 2014–2015 National Health Survey (Australian Bureau of Statistics,
2015) demonstrated that people living in inner regional and outer regional/remote areas of
Australia had higher rates of a number of diseases, including, for example, mental health
problems, arthritis, asthma, deafness and diabetes (Figure 1.2)

Remote and rural Australians also experience higher death rates from injuries, coronary heart
disease, other circulatory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and
suicide (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2014, 2016a). They also have higher selfreported rates of overweight and obesity, daily smoking, risky alcohol consumption, and high
blood pressure, and lower levels of exercise (Figure 1.3) (Australian Institute of Health and
Welfare, 2014, 2016a).

Burden of disease studies have also demonstrated the existence of health inequalities. Burden
of disease, expressed as disability-adjusted life years (DALY),3 “is a measure of the health impact
of disease on a population in a given year both from dying from, and living with, disease and
injuries” (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2016c). Table 1.1 demonstrates that all areas
outside major cities recorded higher rates of disease burden than major cities, and that these
increased with increasing remoteness. Specifically, inner regional and outer regional areas
(207 DALY per 1,000 people) experienced 1.1 times the disease burden of major cities (181
DALY per 1,000 people), while remote (242 DALY per 1,000 people) and very remote (301 DALY
per 1,000 people) areas experienced 1.3 and 1.7 times (respectively) the rate of disease burden
of major cities in 2011 (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2016c).
“This pattern was mostly driven by fatal burden; in very remote areas, the agestandardised rate (ASR) of fatal burden was twice the rate for major cities (178 and 87
YLL per 1,000 people, respectively). As a result, fatal burden made up a greater
proportion of total burden in very remote areas (61%) compared with major cities (49%)”
(Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2016c, p. 92).

The DALY is a health metric that expresses years of life lost (YLL) to premature death and years lived with a disability (YLD) of
known severity and duration—one DALY represents one lost year of healthy life (Murray & Lopez, 1996).

For the majority of disease groups, age-standardised rates of burden increased with increasing
remoteness (Table 1.2). Remote areas had higher rates of burden for injuries, cardiovascular
disease, kidney and urinary diseases, and endocrine disorders (Australian Institute of Health
and Welfare, 2016a, 2016c). Because of the high national rate, cardiovascular disease and
injuries had the greatest absolute difference in rates between major cities and very remote areas
(differences of 28 and 29 DALY per 1,000 people, respectively) (Australian Institute of Health
and Welfare, 2016c).

Similarly, rates of fatal burden of disease among Indigenous Australians were higher in remote
and very remote areas compared to major cities in 2010 (Table 1.3) (Australian Institute of Health
and Welfare, 2015b). Age-standardised rates demonstrated that Indigenous Australians in very
remote areas were 1.5 times as likely as Indigenous Australians in major cities to die prematurely
in 2010 (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2015b).

The leading causes of fatal burden of disease among Indigenous Australians in 2010 were
cardiovascular disease, injuries and cancer (Figure 1.4) (Australian Institute of Health and
Welfare, 2015b). However, when considered by remoteness, injuries was the leading contributor
to fatal burden in major cities and remote and very remote regions, whereas cardiovascular
disease was the leading cause in inner and outer regional areas (Australian Institute of Health
and Welfare, 2015b).

Overall, the fatal burden of disease and injury in the Indigenous population is estimated to be
2.6 times that experienced by non-Indigenous Australians, with injuries (22%) and cardiovascular
disease (21%) contributing the most to the fatal burden of disease for Indigenous Australians
(Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2015c).

1.2.1 Social determinants of health
The poorer health of both non-Indigenous and Indigenous remote and rural Australians is also
impacted by the social determinants of health, which are well recognised nationally and
internationally. The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born,
grow, live, work, and age, and these are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and
resources at global, national, and local levels (World Health Organization, 2015). There are many
social determinants including social, economic, environmental, political, behavioural, and
biological factors, and cultural perceptions (Smith, 2016). Examples of these social determinants
include socio-economic status, access to education, access to health care, employment status,
income, access to affordable housing, stress, age, race, Indigenous status, transport availability,
and disability (World Health Organization, 2015).
In general, people in remote and rural areas have: lower levels of education; lower levels
of employment and lower household incomes; higher rates of inadequate housing; higher
occupational risks and hazards, including physical risks and workplace pressures and stressors
associated with farming and mining; the need for more long-distance travel; poorer access
to fresh foods; and poorer access to health services (Garvan Research Foundation, 2015).
Indigenous Australians experience additional, unique social determinants, which relate to the
loss of language and connection to the land; environmental deprivation; spiritual, emotional, and
mental disconnectedness; lack of cultural respect; lack of opportunities for self-determination;
poor educational attainment; reduced opportunities for employment; poor housing; and negative
interactions with government systems (King, Smith, & Gracey, 2009; Osborne, Baum,
& Brown, 2013).
High levels of social disadvantage and income inequality are evident in many remote and rural
areas (Centre for International Economics, 2015). The Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA),
which uses census data, ranks areas in Australia according to relative socio-economic
advantage and disadvantage, by considering people’s access to material and social resources
and their ability to participate in society (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013c). Comprising four
subscales, variables considered in the index include income, education, employment,
occupation, housing, and other miscellaneous indicators of relative advantage or disadvantage
(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013c). A large proportion of remote areas have a low SEIFA
ranking (Centre for International Economics, 2015). The lower the score, the higher the
disadvantage. Recent research has confirmed that people residing in capital cities are more likely
to be in the top 20% of income earners, while those outside capital cities are more likely to be
in the bottom 20% of income earners (Australian Council of Social Service, 2015). Around 39%
of people living in remote areas have low socio-economic status, compared to 24% in regional
areas and 17% in major cities (Garvan Research Foundation, 2015). This means that in addition
to the practical difficulties associated with living in remote and rural locations, a large proportion
of people living in remote and rural Australia are also some of Australia’s most socioeconomically disadvantaged.
Understanding the impact of socio-economic factors is crucial in light of recent research
claiming that socio-economic factors account for 40% of all influences on health, rather than
clinical care (20%), which has traditionally been identified as the major influence on health (British
Academy, 2014). Other factors, including health behaviours (30%) and the physical environment
(10%), also impact on health (British Academy, 2014).

1.2.2 Access to services
Compared to people living in major cities, remote and rural Australians also have poorer access
to, and demonstrate lower use of, health services (Australian Institute of Health and
Welfare, 2016a).

In 2014, there were 264 full-time equivalent (FTE) medical practitioners per 100,000 population
in remote and very remote areas compared to 437 FTE medical practitioners per 100,000
population in major cities (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2016a). Similarly, there were
25 FTE dentists per 100,000 population in remote and very remote areas compared to 63 FTE
dentists per 100,000 population in major cities (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare,
2016a). These data indicate that people in remote and very remote areas have significantly fewer
medical practitioners and dentists per 100,000 population than people in major cities—
demonstrating poorer access to services. Data from 2010–2011 painted a similar picture—the
number of general practitioner (GP) services provided per person in very remote areas during
2010–2011 was around half that of major cities (Figure 1.5) (Duckett, Breadon, & Ginnivan,
2013). In addition to fewer GP services per person, remote and rural Australians have fewer GP
appointments outside traditional hours (Duckett et al., 2013). Consequently, remote and rural
Australians are more likely to report long waiting periods to see a GP (Duckett et al., 2013)

Access to Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) services by remote and rural Australians is
therefore much lower than for people living in major cities (Centre for International Economics,
2015). People living in very remote areas see GPs at half the rate of people living in major cities,
allied health professionals at one-third of the rate, and specialists at one-fifth of the rate (Centre
for International Economics, 2015). For example, in 2011–2012, 7.6% of city residents accessed
MBS mental health services, compared to 3.0% in remote areas and just 1.5% in very remote
areas (Centre for International Economics, 2015).
Remote and rural Australians also experience poor access to other services resulting in, for
example, lower rates of breast and bowel cancer screening, higher rates of potentially avoidable
hospitalisations, and lower access to selected hospital procedures (Australian Institute of Health
and Welfare, 2016a).
The data presented in this chapter have identified the diseases and illnesses that place the
greatest burden on remote and rural Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and the
difficulties these populations experience in accessing services. Chapter 2 describes the survey
that was developed and administered to a sample of remote and rural Australians to determine
their views on the most important health issues, and areas where money should be spent to
improve health outcomes within their communities.
