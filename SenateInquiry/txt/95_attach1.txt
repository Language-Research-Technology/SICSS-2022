Executive Summary
Providing access to services for small towns is a national challenge in Australia. Our
geography and our settlement patterns are dominated by large cities and their hinterlands,
making service networks difficult to sustain for many small and distant places. Yet as difficult
as this might be, getting basic services right for these places is a key to supporting these
communities and their economies.
To understand the services picture in our smallest towns, the Regional Australia Institute (RAI)
reviewed the long term change in the availability of services delivery professionals in these
communities across 30 years from 1981 to 2011. We measured the number of doctors, nurses,
dentists, police officers, psychologists, teachers, paramedics and social welfare professionals
in small towns in 1981 and again in 2011. Face-to-face service delivery is increasingly
becoming just one of several modes – which now encompass fly-in visits and digital
technologies. But in the period we look at, the number of local service professionals was the
key measure of availability, and analysis of the trends shows some important findings.
We found a mixed picture. While the number of service delivery professionals in some towns
had greatly improved, this growth was limited mainly to inner regional areas. Efforts to
increase the number of service delivery professionals in small towns in other areas were much
less successful. Between 1981 and 2011, the number of professionals in inner regional small
towns grew by 85 per cent, but there was growth of only seven per cent in small towns in
remote and very remote areas. This is despite the fact that education and health outcomes are
consistently worse in remote and very remote areas.
This research found that most towns were more likely to have a nurse or a primary school
teacher than any other type of service delivery professional, including police officers and
health specialists. Small towns are ten to twelve times more likely to have a nurse in their
communities than a GP, and three times more likely to have a primary school teacher than a
police officer. Very few small towns have health specialists within their communities, including
psychologists and dentists, even though mental health and dental health are nationally
significant service priorities. The gaps between small towns and the rest of Australia are
growing for these types of specialist professionals.
Similarly, while the rates of developmental disadvantage in children increase with remoteness,
the number of preschool teachers has gone from an advantage for small towns on a per
capita basis, to a deficit. Getting service delivery professionals into small towns in very remote
areas remains challenging.

Although there are instances where the gap in service delivery personnel between major cities
and small towns is closing, overall these gaps remain significant and for some professions the
trend is that the gaps are widening rather than narrowing. Across the country billions of
dollars are provided from governments in support for professionals to work in small places,
but clearly these initiatives are not always working as well as hoped.
This research has several implications for policy makers, specifically:
• Support community led initiatives. Some towns are bypassing state and
Commonwealth processes in order to attract service delivery professionals to their
communities. Some places have worked around administration-heavy procedures to
entice education and health professionals by offering attractive housing or low-rent
business premises. These efforts should be encouraged and supported as part of
professional support programs.
• Flexibility in the roles of professionals in small towns. Where there are service
professionals located in small towns, their scope of work needs to be flexible enough
to better meet community needs. For example, perhaps pharmacists and nurses should
be able to provide vaccinations, dress wounds and take x-rays.
• Virtual service delivery methods such as online services should complement the
presence of service delivery professionals in small towns rather than replace them
outright. Virtual services have the potential to significantly widen the scope of services
that can be delivered to small town populations without the need for extensive travel.
However, there is still considerable debate about the effectiveness of virtual only
services that are delivered in isolation from local professionals, and how to embed
virtual services most effectively. Services that complement and extend the scope of
practice for local generalists rather than seeking to replace them should be the
priority.
• Incentives need to target hard to staff areas. The growth in inner regional service
professionals combined with their proximity to more populous places with a great
range of services lessens their need for support. Incentives to professionals should be
closely targeted to promote growth in the professionals available in the remote areas
that need them most.
Consistent face-to-face access to service delivery professionals is an important part of
improving outcomes in small towns and in improving longer-term economic and social prospects
in some of Australia’s most disadvantaged places.

Introduction
In Australia, small towns were originally settled to develop and service the nation’s rural
industries. Governments also promoted inland settlement and agricultural communities in
regional areas.i Small towns continue to be foundations of the economic and social life of
regional Australia, and core professional services are the community pillars built on these
foundations.
The quality of access to services in these communities is fundamental to community wellbeing. It
also has a direct relationship to productivity of its local economy. If people have poor health
or are poorly educated, they are more likely to rely on social welfare, to have lower wages
and living standards. When people cannot access the services and support their family needs,
they may move to areas where they can access this support or choose not to move to a small
town at all.
Although there are trends of population decline, the perception that small towns are, in and of
themselves, ‘dying’ does not hold.ii Between 1981 and 2011, the number of Australians living
in small towns rose, both as a raw number and as a proportion of the national population.iii
Some small towns experience population decline and associated losses, but others have grown.
In 1981 7.9 per cent of the Australian population lived in small towns. By 2011 this proportion
had grown to 8.5 per cent.
As the economic base and populations of small towns shift, so too do the kinds of social, health
and education resources and services that they require. Needs are different, but often not well
understood. While the divide between regional and urban Australia has been well publicised,
the growing division within ‘regional Australia’ is less well appreciated. When pooled together
with other non-urban areas and places, the divide dilutes any focus on the unique issues that
are faced by small towns outside major cities.
With this in mind, the Regional Australia Institute (RAI) has explored the smaller towns of
Australia in their own right – those communities outside of major metropolitan areas and with
populations less than 5,000 people. To begin to understand the unique challenges of service
provision in these communities, we have tracked over the long term the prevalence and percapita ratio of service delivery professionals in small Australian towns from 1981 to 2011.
The research is based on a customised data set provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
on census counts of specific occupations over the period for small towns with populations
between 200 and 5,000 people.
Tracking this change does not provide a complete picture of changes in services delivery, as
other ways of delivering services are emerging beyond face-to-face modes. Fly-in specialists
are becoming more commonplace, as is use of digital technologies to both deliver previously
unavailable services and augment existing services. But tracking the number of local
professionals provides a consistent foundation for assessing a community’s capacity to access
Pillars of communities: Service delivery professionals in small Australian towns 1981 – 2011

Submission 95 - Attachment 1

face-to-face services over the long term. Our results can be updated with data from the
2016 census, but we chose the 30 year period to 2011 to separate the long term trends from
the shorter term influences of current policy settings.
People are the foundation of small town economies. When people in small towns are
supported, communities can more successfully meet economic challenges and can better adapt
to structural change.iv A town’s ability to do this depends not only on its natural assets,
capacity to access investors or even on the experience and skills of its labour force. Crucially,
it also depends on the level of social capital in a town, on people’s ability to share ideas,
work together and to build a community.v The Australian Governments most recent regional
policy statement Regions 2030 asserts that, “regional Australia’s greatest asset has always
been its people.” vi
Small towns outside major cities continue to punch above their weight in the economy. They are
home to primary producing industries including agriculture, mining and some manufacturing,
which together accounted for 22 per cent of the GDP in 2010 and 16 per cent of national
employment. vii
But Australia has not been able to nurture and develop the people who live in its small towns.
These people continue to experience poorer health outcomes than their fellow Australians.
Those living in rural and remote small towns have lower life expectancy, higher rates of
disease and injury than people living in urban areas do. More people die of coronary heart
disease or diabetes and the rate of death by suicide is four times that of cities.viii The rate of
hospitalisation from mental health conditions, intentional self-harm and from drug or alcohol
use is higher in rural and remote communities as well. They are also higher for youth in rural
and remote settings than in urban settings.ix
Education outcomes are poorer for communities in these areas too. One third of students in
regional and rural areas do not finish year 12 and only 18 per cent will go on to complete a
university degree. Rural students are up to one and a half years behind their metropolitan
counterparts on NAPLAN and PISA tests.x Worryingly, this disadvantage manifests in early
childhood as children in rural, regional and remote areas are more likely to be
developmentally vulnerable than children in metro areas. This trend worsens with remoteness
as children in very remote areas are twice as likely as those in major cities to be
developmentally vulnerable. xi
The presence of service delivery professionals is one key way that social outcomes in a
community can be improved. In turn, there is clear evidence that improved social outcomes
help to sustain rises in the income and living standards of people in a community.xii Failure to
change these headline results is not for want of trying. Governments in all jurisdictions continue
to invest in programs to entice teachers, nurses, GPs and police officers to underserviced small
towns in rural and remote locations.

The 2017-18 Commonwealth budget alone allocated over $2 billion to be spent over four
years on workforce and incentive programs to improve the numbers of health delivery
professionals in rural and remote areas. A similar Commonwealth program for teachers called
‘Teach for Australia’ has been allocated $77.6 million and supplements a variety of ongoing
state based incentive programs to entice teachers to schools in small towns. The analysis in the
report shows, however, that while the number of service professionals in small towns went up
between 1981 and 2011, including for GPs and teachers, numbers are falling in the smaller
and more remote places.
The absence of these services (and their poorer quality when they are provided) in smaller
and more remote towns is one of the reasons that people, especially those with young families,
move away from towns in these areas.xiii
As well as providing impetus to move away from small towns, poor educational, health and
social outcomes do not allow people in small towns to fulfil their potential. Lower rates of
wellbeing are associated with poorer productivity in an area and poor levels of educational
attainment jeopardises the long-term strength of an area’s economy, weakening its bank of
human capital. xiv xv A lack of access to GPs, dentists, pharmacies and other primary health
facilities for rural and remote individuals in Australia results in more than 60,000 preventable
hospitalisations every year.xvi

Small Towns in Australia
In this report we look at small towns by population size and by remoteness. In Australia in
2011 there were 1,555 small towns – towns with population from 200 to 5,000 residents.
Most of these were in the eastern states though WA has a large number of towns with
populations under 1,000.

Table 1: Small towns in Australia, 2011 by size.

Being a small town is actually a dynamic state. Most places have stayed within our population
ranges for the whole period of the data. While other places have grown beyond the 5,000
threshold, and a few settlements, mainly around the fringes of east coast capital cities, have
grown to reach the small town population benchmark.
Small towns are spread across the Australian land mass. The spread mirrors the town size
distribution, with most categorised as ‘Inner Regional’ in the ARIA Remoteness classification. A
map showing the different remoteness classifications across the country is shown on the
following page, and more detail on the remoteness classification is presented in Appendix A4.
Inner Regional areas are those closest to the great capital city fringes, and the remoteness
classification increases with distance from major population centres.

Face-to-Face Access to Service Delivery Professionals
The total number of service delivery professionals in small towns increased between 1981 and
2011. Across Australia, the number of these professionals grew by 61per cent during this
period. In small towns, it grew by 70 per cent, outstripping the rate of population growth.
However this growth was uneven both because some professions increased more than others
did, and because the growth was affected by remoteness. In 2011, there were twelve times
as many psychologists in small towns than in 1981, an additional 1,000 GPs and around
10,000 more nurses. In 2011, 58 per cent of service delivery professionals were in small
towns in inner regional areas, 28 per cent in outer regional, 7 per cent in remote and 7 per
cent in very remote areas.

Table 2: Rate of service delivery professional per 100,000 population, 2011 by remoteness.

Table 2 highlights the extent of the service gap facing residents of small towns. The numbers
show that on a per-capita basis (the number of service delivery professionals per 100,000
population equivalent), nationally nurses are the most numerous – at an average of 1,045 per
100,000 residents. Australia has a quite high ratio of teachers to population as well,
averaging 639 primary school and 581 high school teachers per 100,000 residents. Least

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 95 - Attachment 1

numerous nationally are paramedics (56 per 100,000 residents) and dentists (81 per
100,000 residents).
These ratios show the importance of decentralised and widely distributed nurses and teachers
as vital service providers in all communities across Australia. The ratios also show that more
specialist professionals such as dentists and paramedics are much less likely to be distributed
across smaller communities.
The scale of the service gap in small
towns is clear. Small towns, on
average, have 83 doctors per
100,000 people, well under half
the national average of 202. The
gap in psychologists is even greater
– just 29 per 100,000 small town
residents compared with a national
average of 87. This is despite the
well-studied importance and
prevalence of mental health needs
and issues in regional areas.xvii
Social welfare professional numbers
in small towns are also well below
the national average.

Behind the data
The information presented is drawn from a customised
dataset provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
showing people in selected professional service
occupations in small towns from 1981 to 2011. More
details are provided in Appendix A4. Mapping the
long term 30 year trends in the number of these
professionals in small towns gives a consistent
foundation to the analysis. However census counts are
unreliable when small numbers (eg less than 5 people)
are present and so may not always reflect the actual
number of professionals living in a place. Our report
therefore presents numbers aggregated to town size
and remoteness classifications.

Small towns are well serviced with some professions. The gap in nursing is much smaller (1,009
per 100,000 compared with the national average of 1,045). The nursing numbers show that
small towns have over 10 times the availability of nurses compared with GPs – emphasising
the crucial role that nurses play in regional health. Also of note, while there are far fewer
paramedics per 100,000 residents, this ratio is also higher in small towns than the national
average, indicating that this occupation too is helping to fill the gap left by the much lower
representation of GPs. As an example of how these ratios play out in small towns, the 1981
Census of the town of Hay in NSW counted 23 nurses and three GPs, a ratio of 7.7 nurses per
GP.
Small towns are also quite well served with teachers. While there is a small gap for small
towns in preschool teachers, the ratios of primary and high school teachers per 100,000 are
above the national average. This confirms the importance placed on education by all
governments, and the efforts the nation goes to, to ensure that a good education is available
at all levels across our smallest and most decentralised communities.
Policing is the other occupation well represented in small towns – with per capita ratios above
the national average.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 95 - Attachment 1

When we look at the availability of service delivery professionals across small towns in
different locations, the table shows clearly that the more remote the town, the lower the ratios
of professionals to population. The exceptions are primary school teachers, police and social
welfare professionals, with each higher on a per-capita basis in very remote towns than in less
remote towns. These figures demonstrate the importance of these three professions in
supporting a viable remote small town. It could be said that the presence of a nurse and a
primary school now defines a small town.
For all the other health and education professions, the more remote your small town the less
likely you are to have a person in the occupation actually in your community. This holds for
general health (GPs and nurses) as it does for specialist health professionals (psychologists
and dentists). In fact at a ratio of just five psychologists per 100,000 residents equivalent, in
very remote small towns availability is less than one fifteenth of the national average. This
brings long travel times to residents of these small towns wanting to use psychological services,
and highlights the underlying need for tele and video links of suitable quality to be available
as a matter of national urgency.
To understand how this picture has changed over time, Table 3 looks at the share of small
towns with at least one of these professionals in 1981 and 2011.
The picture since 1981 is mixed. In 2011, there were twelve times as many psychologists in
small towns than in 1981, an additional 1,000 GPs and around 10,000 more nurses. In 2011,
58 per cent of service delivery professionals were in small towns in inner regional areas, 28
per cent in outer regional, 7 per cent in remote and 7 per cent in very remote areas.
In 2011, there were fewer small towns with a dentist, a pre-school, primary or secondary
school teacher or a police officer than there had been previously. However, there were
slightly more or about the same number of small towns that had a general practitioner, a
nurse, a paramedic, or a social welfare professional in its community. Although the gap
compared to wider Australia remains very large, six times more small towns do have access to
a psychologist than in 1981.

Table 3: Proportion of all small towns with service delivery professions within the community,
1981 – 2011

Overall, most small towns are more likely to have a nurse, a primary school teacher or a
secondary school teacher than any other service delivery professional. Where a small town
has a teacher in their community, they are most likely to teach at primary school. Small towns
are more than twice as likely to have a police officer as a paramedic or a social welfare
worker. They are around four times more likely to have a nurse than a GP.
These ratios show the importance of decentralised and widely distributed nurses and teachers
as vital service providers in all communities across Australia.
Box One: Coonamble, NSW
Coonamble in NSW is 161 kilometres north of
Dubbo. Between 1981 and 2001, the town’s
population fell by 21% to 2,447. The 1981
Census counted six GPs, 17 nurses, 29
primary school teachers, 41 secondary school
teachers and five social welfare professionals
in the town. In 2011, Census data indicated
the number of nurses had increased by one to
10 (6% increase), primary school teachers to
16 (45% fall) and secondary school teachers
to 15 (63% fall). The 2011 Census also
recorded no GP or social welfare
professional in Coonamble.

Box Two: Tully, Queensland
Tully is a small town 141 kilometres south of
Cairns, Queensland. According to Census
data, Tully had a 2011 population of
2,264, which was a 17% decrease from
1981. Census data indicates that during the
30 years to 2011, the number of GPs in the
town remained constant although the
number of nurses fell from 18 to eight and
the number of primary school teachers from
20 to nine. This means that the number of
both nurses and primary school teachers fell
by around 55% between 1981 and 2011,
even though Tully’s population fell by only
17%.

The Impact of Remoteness on Professional Availability
It is well understood that the severity of health, education and welfare divides in regional
communities is greater according to remoteness. The corresponding challenges that small towns
face in accessing service delivery professionals in remote areas is a fundamental contributor to
these persistent inequalities in Australia.
Table 4 shows the proportions of small towns with each type of service delivery professional in
1981 and 2011 broken down by remoteness.xviii With the exception of primary school
teachers, remote or very remote towns have lower per-capita rates of service delivery
professionals in their communities than the average Australian small town.
Unfortunately the situation has not improved in the last 30 years. There were fewer remote
and very remote towns in 2011 with a nurse, psychologist, dentist, preschool or secondary
teacher, police officer, paramedic, or social welfare professional, than in 1981. Towns in outer
regional areas had fewer service delivery professionals in their communities than they did 30
years previously. Slightly more towns in these regions had GPs, nurses and psychologists than
in 1981, but this trend was limited to these occupations.

More small towns in inner regional areas were more likely to have GPs, nurses and
psychologists, secondary school teachers, paramedics or social welfare professionals in their
communities in 2011 than they did in 1981. These Inner Regional towns are located in
regional areas but tend to border urban hubs or metropolitan centres making the local
populations reliance on local service professional much less important than in more remote
towns.
For example, the small Inner Regional town of Mount Torrens in South Australia is 46
kilometres from Adelaide and recorded a population of 336 in 2011. Between 1981 and
2011, the census counts of the number of nurses doubled from four to eight. Over the same

period Boonah, 48 kilometres south of Ipswich in Queensland, census counts showed an
increase of three psychologists, nine nurses and three secondary teachers.
There were more small towns in all remoteness categories with GPs in their communities in
2011 than there were in 1981. However, there were fewer remote and very remote small
towns with a nurse in their community in 2011 than in 1981. There were more small towns in
inner and outer regional areas with psychologists than in 1981; however, there were fewer
psychologists within remote and very remote small towns in 2011 than 30 years previous.
There were also fewer dentists in small towns in all remoteness categories than there were in
1981.

The Impact of Town Size on Professional Availability
Town size influences a community’s capacity to directly access and support a mix of service
delivery professionals. In 2011, all small towns with populations from 2,500 to 5,000
residents (to meet our small town criteria) had a nurse and a primary school teacher in their
communities. Just under half of them had a police officer too. The picture for other service
delivery professionals is more mixed.
In general, small towns with populations of 2,500 or over tend to have better access to service
professionals both in raw numbers and on a per-capita basis. However, these towns still have
poorer per-capita rates associated with access to GPs, nurses, dentists, and social welfare
professionals than the average Australian. Yet there has been some improvement and the
rates for all teachers, police officers and paramedics have matched or bettered national percapita averages.
Towns with populations under 1,000 continue to experience poorer direct access to service
delivery professionals. Proportionally, there were fewer towns of this size with professionals in
their community than there were in 1981 (except for GPs and nurses, which stayed about the
same). These towns fare the worst on per-capita access measures, experiencing gaps in access
to most health care professionals, preschool and secondary school teachers, paramedics and
social welfare professionals.
Towns with populations between 1,000 and 2,499 continued to experience poorer per-capita
rates than the Australian average for all professionals except primary school teachers, police
officers and paramedics.

Are the Gaps Closing?
Overall, small town communities continue to have poorer per-capita access rates to service
delivery professionals than the national average. Exceptions to this are for police officers,
primary school teachers and paramedics. Although there have been improvements since 1981
the gap between small towns and national rates continues to be significant.
On headcount numbers, the numbers of all service delivery professionals increased in small
towns between 1981 and 2011 (see Appendix A2). Not only this, but the average growth
was higher than the national average for the same period (70 per cent compared to 61 per
cent). For small towns this growth outstripped population growth in all service categories
except dentists, secondary teachers and preschool teachers, and helped close the service gap
in key areas. Between 1981 and 2011 small towns maintained better per-capita access to
primary school teachers, police officers and paramedics than the Australian average. Percapita access to secondary school teachers has fallen over this period but remains slightly
above the national average.
Small towns continue to experience a lower per-capita access to psychologists and dentists
than the Australian average. While small towns had a twelve-fold increase in the number of
psychologists within their communities, there was still a substantial gap in per-capita rates
between small towns and the national average. Per-capita access to dentists also deteriorated
considerably for residents of small towns between 1981 and 2011. Tables 6 and 7 below
show the improvement in per-capita access for small towns in the thirty years to 2011.
This per-capita measure is important because it tracks the service benchmark across Australia
as a whole. It shows that while there may be more service delivery professionals in a
particular town, this increase does not guarantee equal access to services between small towns
and larger cities or regional centres. In fact, a comparison of the per-capita rates (per
100,000 population) of service delivery professionals in small towns against national
averages shows that in many cases, the service gap has not been closed.

Per-capita provision of police officers in small towns tracked above the national average over
the period. The gap between small towns and the national average in the per-capita rate for
paramedics halved between 1981 and 2011 although the gap for welfare service
professionals closed only slightly.
Psychologists and dentists present the starkest gaps between small towns and the Australian
averages. While small towns had a twelve-fold increase in the number of psychologists within
their communities, there was still a substantial growth in the gap in per-capita rates between
small towns and the national average (Figure 1). The significance of this growing gap needs to
be seen in the context of a concentration of mental health issues and suicides in regional and
remote Australia.

Per-capita access to dentists also deteriorated considerably for residents of small towns
between 1981 and 2011. Again, dental health is an issue that is considerably worse in
regional and remote areas.
New gaps are also emerging in crucial areas for small towns. Per-capita rates also show that
although in 1981 small towns had an advantage in the number of preschool, primary school
and secondary school teachers in their community, this advantage has been maintained only in
the case of primary school teachers. While the per-capita rate of secondary school teachers in
small towns is more or less level with the national average, it is a significant decrease from the
1981 measure. From a place of advantage in 1981, the per-capita rate of preschool
teachers has now fallen well below the national rate in 2011 (Figure 2). Again, this lack of
service professionals coincides with substantially higher rates of early childhood development
issues and an increasing recognition of the role that early childhood development plays in
later life.

These gaps have significant impact on the wellbeing of those in small town communities. Taking
health as an example, it is estimated that a lack of access to GPs, dentists and other health
services in rural and remote areas results in 60,000 preventable hospitalisations each year.
People defer seeking health services because of out-of-pocket expenses, including the costs
associated with transport, accommodation and income forgone to travel to appointments
where services are not locally available. As the population of regional Australia ages, the
demands placed on service delivery professionals will increase. Worryingly, small towns in
outer regional and remote areas that already experience lower per-capita rates of direct
access to some health professionals are ageing more quickly than other parts of the country.
This is set to place greater strain on already stretched resources.xix
Overall in 2011, small town per-capita rates for psychologists, preschool teachers and social
welfare professionals were all well below comparable national rates. Given the high rates of
children in regional Australia who are developmentally vulnerable, it is unlikely that these
issues can be resolved without better access to professional support.
In general, the more remote a small town, the poorer its per-capita access to the professionals
who can most effectively address developmental vulnerability. For example, towns in very
remote areas where the rate of developmental vulnerability is close to double that of major
cities, per-capita access to psychologists and preschool teachers is lower than in any other
part of regional Australia. Towns with populations under 1,000 record lower per-capita rates
to psychologists, preschool teachers and social welfare professionals than do towns with larger
populations. A brief discussion of the impact of remoteness and town size on these rates is at
Appendix A3.

Case Studies
Census data provides a compelling but broad picture of the distribution of service delivery
professionals in Australian small towns. To supplement this, we have prepared case studies so
that we can better understand the effect of access gaps for people in these communities.
These case studies show that people in small towns without service delivery professionals have
little choice but to travel to access services. This is costly, burdensome and can ultimately
compel people with a greater need for services to move to larger, regional centres.
These studies also show that small towns have trouble not only attracting service delivery
professionals, but also retaining them. Small towns are more likely to attract professionals at
the beginning of their career who may be getting a compulsory rural rotation ‘over and done
with’ before settling down in a metropolitan centre. xx Attracting and retaining professionals in
rural and remote areas is no easy task and successful efforts have tended to be multi-faceted,
balancing financial incentives, quality accommodation and opportunities for ‘escape’ to cities
with broader efforts to improve the amenity of a small town itself.

Health services in Hay, NSW
Hay is a small town located in the south-western, Murray-Riverina region of New South Wales,
with a strong agricultural industry and around 3,000 residents in the township and surrounding
Shire. It is around 150km from the regional hubs of Deniliquin and Narrandera, and 200km
from the Victorian border.
1981 Census data shows Hay had a population of 2,952. The census recorded three GPs and
23 nurses in 1981. By 2011, Hay’s population had declined to 2,296 – a reduction of 22 per
cent. Census data records that in the same period the town lost all of its GPs and 26 percent
of its nurses. Conversely, Hay gained two paramedics up from three to five. In both the 1981
and 2011 censuses, there was no recognised mental health professional (such as a
psychologist, social worker or counsellor)
recorded in the town.
Without direct access to service delivery
professionals within the town, residents of
Hay travel 150km to Deniliquin or
Wagga Wagga, or interstate to Victoria
Figure 1 - Travel of residents of Hay, NSW for medical services

resident suffering an asthmatic episode,
it was easier to make the 300km round
trip to Deniliquin for assistance than seek

able to provide some patient transportation, usually a patient’s friends and family shoulder
the burden of ensuring a patient reaches a service provider.

Aside from the personal toll of such arrangements on individual patients, a lack of medical
services in Hay impacts on the business sector and the overall productivity of the town. For
example, locals who need a medical certificate face a choice between a lengthy wait at the
only available local GP, or a full day round trip to neighbouring towns.
As a consequence, small town community members are more likely to put off or skip medical
visits, treatments, tests and medications because of the time and financial costs associated with
this task. As research shows, a lack of access to GPs, dentists, pharmacies and other primary
health facilities for rural and remote individuals in Australia is estimated to result in more than
60,000 preventable hospitalisations every year.xxii
Communities like Hay 200km from major service centres keenly experience the limitations of a
model that relies on population measures to distribute service professionals. Under hub and
spoke service models, the part-time presence of a service representative provides ‘outreach’
to the community. The intention of these visiting officers is to ‘plug’ any gap created by the
town’s lack of full time service professionals. Government departments can claim this part-time
outreach program as a ‘local presence’ in a community. In Hay for example, a representative
from the NSW government’s Ageing, Disability and Home Care services is in the town for one
day each fortnight doing ‘outreach’. This professional is based in a nearby hub. Some have
expressed concern that the time allocated for Hay is insufficient for the officer to both provide
services to townspeople and to liaise with local planners about service delivery, especially if
an issue involves other government departments.

Education in Queenstown, TAS
Long associated with the mining industry,
Queenstown is a small town in the mountainous
West Coast region of Tasmania. Queenstown’s
economy has long experienced the cycles of boom
and bust as mines have opened and closed (and
sometimes reopened). As a terminus for the West
Coast Railway, Queenstown is well placed to invest
in tourism as a counter to the fluctuations that come
from its reliance on mining. However, this shift takes
time and the impact of a slow population decline is
reflected in falling numbers of service delivery professionals, such as teachers.
In 1981, Queenstown’s population was 3,721 but this had fallen to 1,971 by 2011, and
corresponded to a decline in the number of primary and secondary school teachers over the
same period. In 1981, the census counted 36 primary and 28 secondary teachers in the town
but by 2011, the counts had fallen to 18 and six respectively. While the population had fallen
by 47 per cent in this time, the number of primary school teachers fell by 50 per cent and the
number of secondary teachers by 79 per cent. These falls were in line with a broader trend

25

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 95 - Attachment 1

within the town where townspeople noted a lack of access to welfare and social workers,
dentists and health professionals.xxiii
Although there are financial incentives offered to attract teachers to remote and rural areas,
these alone are insufficient to counter disincentives such as a lack of development
opportunities, inadequate housing and a perceived lack of social and cultural amenities.xxiv In
1999, teachers in Queenstown identified the quality of the accommodation as a deterrent for
new teaching staff:
Basically we are provided with accommodation but it is costing an arm and a leg
to live here … it is very basic housing and we had the union official here only last
week to complain about the state of the housing. xxv
Twelve years later housing continued to be an issue for teachers in Queenstown. An audit
commissioned by the state Department of Education found that several of the properties
provided to teachers were “considered to require significant refurbishment” and there were
issues with security as well as “mould and the cost of heating.”xxvi The audit identified a
particular ‘complex’ of units, about which teachers had long complained, which was at risk of
flooding and erosion from a nearby river and was in such a state of disrepair that it “would
be difficult to bring up to a better standard.”xxvii
Queenstown’s situation is not unique. In many remote or rural locations, there is a limited
housing market and where private rental properties are available these are usually at
inflated prices and thus unaffordable for teachers newly appointed to these communities who
are generally just entering the profession and so at the bottom of the salary range. xxviii Access
to safe, well-maintained accommodation is important to attract and maintain teachers in small
town communities.

Service provision in the remote town of Bourke, NSW
Located in north-western NSW, Bourke is a small town of around 2,600 people. It is 350km
from the regional city of Dubbo and 500km from Orange. Under the ABS remoteness
structure, Bourke is classified as being in the highest category of geographic remoteness.
Despite this remoteness, across a number of service professional categories Bourke appears to
have a per-capita rate of access that is in line with or above national average. Per-capita
access to GPs and nurses was below the national average in 1981, but above it in 2011.
Similarly, the town continues to have higher rates of access to teachers and police than the
average Australian.
Yet residents of Bourke are increasingly attending the regional hubs of Dubbo and Orange to
access primary health care. This is a consequence of what many in the town see as a
withdrawal of local clinical health services by NSW Health to its hub centres of Dubbo and
Orange. The local ‘disinvestment’ means that many forms of primary care are no longer
available in Bourke. Where positions are filled (such as with GPs), professionals are often
earlier in their career or International Medical Graduates still under clinical supervision.

Bourke has experienced a complete loss
of dental services. The 2011 Census
recorded that there are no dentists
within the town, even though three were
counted in 1981. Neither Census
records Bourke as having a psychologist
in the town. Residents can wait for
months to receive dental treatment and
are often unable to receive mental
health support they require. Some
pregnant women have moved to Dubbo
400km away to access effective pre
and antenatal services.

Incentive programs for regional policing
In 2011, 46 per cent of small towns had direct access to a police officer in their community.
Although this total figure was down from 55 per cent in 1981, the per-capita rate had
improved for most small towns (with the exception of those in outer regional areas, which
experienced a decrease that shifted them below the national average). The gap between the
small towns and the national average had closed in all but these outer regional areas. This
held for small towns across all three of the population thresholds. xxix
Attracting and retaining staff in remote and rural small towns has been an issue for police
forces in all Australian jurisdictions. During the mining boom in the mid to late 2000s this was
especially difficult as a police officer’s salary was outstripped by the wages that mining
companies were able to offer in these remote areas. As with other service delivery
professionals, a lack of adequate accommodation and social infrastructure, access to
professional development opportunities and the prospect of being always ‘on duty’ have
provided disincentives to officers to move to some small towns. Additionally, some officers are
disinclined to work in these areas because of the nature of the work, which with a heavy
emphasis on community police can be seen as ‘not real policing’ ‘welfare work’.xxx
Faced with these disincentives and with persistent shortages of staff, some Australian states
have introduced programs to attract and retain police officers in small towns, especially in
remote areas. In Western Australia, the police service enhanced relocation packages and
facilities and improved the number of local and regional recruits, who are more likely to
remain in small communities. They also requested funds from large organisations in small and
remote towns to invest in community initiatives and facilities. And although the option was
never used, there was a program that would use Fly in Fly out (FIFO) police officers to
augment existing numbers.xxxi

The FIFO model has been considered by several states and a variation of it was trialled in the
Northern Territory in 2013. Here, six Darwin based officers worked on a rotational roster,
spending some time in the small community of Maningrida but rostered days off back in
Darwin. In 2015, the town was a trial site for the successful introduction of Aboriginal Liaison
Officers, who worked alongside police officers in remote communities. xxxii
In South Australia, a police FIFO arrangement at Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY
Lands) also engaged Community Constables from the local indigenous communities. After it
became difficult to recruit the Community Constables, other officers were flown in temporarily,
with a lack of infrastructure including police housing preventing a more permanent
arrangement. Subsequently the state and Commonwealth governments cooperated to build
the necessary infrastructure, particularly housing for officers and their families and developed
incentives for officers to live and work in the location. xxxiii

Where to From Here?
People in regional and remote areas have poorer access to service delivery professionals
than those in metropolitan centres and regional cities. While outright numbers of professionals
in small towns increased through to 2011, the increases were mostly in the easier-to-service
Inner Regional and larger small towns. The continuing access gaps in other places make it
difficult if not impossible for Australia to make any progress in reducing the significant gaps
which underpin the divides between regional and metropolitan health and education outcomes.
They require a more effective policy response than efforts to date.
Over the last thirty years, face-to-face access to service delivery professionals in small towns
has been heavily influenced by wider service reforms. Within these reforms, the drive for
economies of scale in service provision has invariably come to include per-capita thresholds,
which are difficult to meet in sparsely populated and non-urban areas.
The mechanisms that determine the placement and access to service delivery professionals
have different effects in small towns and communities than they do in our more highly
populated major cities and regional towns. Services in smaller, more sparsely populated
communities have been reduced or relocated to larger regional hubs so that economies of
scale can be realised. Those in small towns have often had to travel further to access face-toface service delivery professionals than those in more urbanised parts of the country as a
consequence of these changes.
At the same time as achieving efficiencies in the wider services systems, governments of all
levels have attempted to address gaps in service availability with regional specific initiatives
that include both substantial funding and policy effort. The 2017-18 Commonwealth budget
alone allocated over $2 billion to be spent over four years on workforce and incentive
programs to improve the numbers of health delivery professionals in rural and remote areas.
These are in addition to bonded places at universities or discounted HECS fees. A similar
Commonwealth program for teachers called ‘Teach for Australia’ has been allocated $77.6
million and supplements a variety of ongoing state based incentive programs to entice
teachers to schools in small towns. Millions of dollars of incentives have been offered to
teachers, nurses and police officers over the last few decades and have included specialised
professional development, affordable or even free accommodation, allowances, cash
payments and extra leave. However, even these are not always enough to bring and keep
enough service delivery professionals into small communities.
Australia is not unique in facing these issues. Policy makers in the UK have recognised that
rural communities face issues of distance and sparse populations that can diminish their
capacity to access government provided services. Official guidance has been developed for
policy makers so that when designing programs or service changes, consideration is given to
the particular demography of rural communities as well as specific issues related to access to
roads or digital connectivity.xxxiv In Canada, policy makers now focus on developing specific

resources, infrastructure and networks of care to counteract the inequality of access to health
services that remoteness produces for rural and sparsely populated communities.
While this report does not recommend definitive resolutions to these issues, it does point
towards three approaches that should be further developed:
1. Support places in most need to solve local access problems
2. Increase access to specialist digitally provided services
3. Increase the capacity and scope of effective services that the professional presence in
these communities can provide.

Supporting places in most need to solve local access problems
In the light of persistent underservicing, several towns and their councils are trying to plug
service gaps themselves. Some are avoiding the administrative burden of state and
Commonwealth systems altogether and offering their own tailored incentives to service
delivery professionals to relocate to their towns.
In Hay, the local council chose to subsidise medical and dental services out of one of its own
buildings. The council also organised and funded counselling and mental health services
independently of other levels of government. In nearby Temora, the local Council has adapted
a council property into a medical complex and offered low cost rent to new doctors in an
effort to spur on private sector growth. The complex has seen the number of practising doctors
triple and there has been an associated expansion of supporting services such as medical
imaging and telemedicine. The Temora Council has built on this success by introducing in-home
and community care, leading to the introduction of Pinnacle Community Services, offering
disability services and aged care to the community.
When Ceduna, South Australia, had trouble attracting general practitioners to the area, the
local Council stepped in to provide high quality accommodation as an incentive. A number of
lodges were built on the picturesque foreshore for the town’s doctors and now, several years
later, the accommodation is wholly managed by the state agency SA Health.
While there is much to gain in studying the effectiveness of these initiatives and while such
innovation is to be applauded, these initiatives are band-aid solutions to a larger problem.
They are ad-hoc programs that rely on the financial and entrepreneurial agility of individual
local governments and as such cannot address the systemic issues that drive poor access to
service delivery professionals in small towns in the first place. While these local governments
are to be commended for plugging a service gap, a broader, holistic approach is needed to
understand and address the persistent service gaps between small towns and other parts of
the country.

Increasing the Scope and Accessibility of Digital Services
As services have moved away from small towns, governments have sought to ameliorate the
physical absences of service delivery professionals by offering access through call centres
and, in time, the internet.
Digital services are a clear priority for many governments looking to improve service delivery
in remote regions. But they should not be seen as a panacea as they bring with them issues of
digital capacity (both digital literacy of users and availability and reliability of required
bandwidth and connection speed) and the need to define the most appropriate role of digital
support in providing services. xxxv
Digital services are likely to be more effective when they work to support, complement and
augment face to face service services rather than replace them entirely. In health, face to face
service is still regarded as the first preference, but if this is not available then virtual follow up
can be valuable. xxxvi Digital technologies are well suited to augmenting generalist services
with specialist services, especially when there is a generalist service professional available to
incorporate the specialist expertise.xxxvii Digital services also have potential to coordinate
clients or providers, and bring virtual economies of scale in sparsely populated regions. The
role and potential of digital services in remoter regions is worthy of further investigation.
Remote provision can easily disadvantage regional service users. When the Commonwealth
government disbanded the Commonwealth Employment Service and established Centrelink
and the Job Network, service providers began to leave small towns and centralise in larger
regional hubs. Centrelink established several call centres and separate, dedicated telephone
numbers for different services were set up although many calls went unanswered and waiting
times of one hour were expected.xxxviii Job seekers in remote areas were 50 per cent more
likely to contact their job network provider by telephone than those in metropolitan areas.xxxix
People in remote and rural areas who used mobiles also faced increasing costs associated
with wait times and being placed on hold. Similarly, a GP helpline has been established for
Australians to access GP services after hours. In 2016, Health Direct Australia reported that
70 per cent of calls to this line were made by people without access to a local GP in the
evenings, on the weekend or on public holidays.xl
More recently, people in rural and remote areas have been able to access health services
over the internet. Using Skype, people can access a specialist (where they are located over
150km away) and still claim a Medicare rebate. While people are able to use Skype to
access GPs and even to arrange a medical certificate, these services are not covered by the
Medicare rebate. Even where internet or call centres can help deliver services to small towns,
face-to-face contact is still essential. The Black Dog Institute reports that while online
technologies increasingly play a role in delivering mental health support to young people in
remote and rural areas, it is vital that they be able to directly access a service delivery
professional for intensive assistance.xli The cost effectiveness of online and telephone services
clearly has to be balanced with access to professionals within the community.

Submission 95 - Attachment 1

State and Commonwealth governments have also moved to offer more services online or
through mobile apps. This move is not necessarily a response to the withdrawal of service
delivery professionals from towns and cities but rather a trend facilitated by improvements in
digital technology. However, as this trend rolls out it brings into sharp relief the digital
inequality that exists between metropolitan and urban cities and the more regional and
remote areas of Australia. This ‘country-city digital divide’ limits the capacity of those in small
towns to access services that are partially or entirely provided online and presents a serious
challenge for Australia’s Digital Reform Agenda.xlii
Often conceived of as access to an internet connection, this focus on connection captures only
part (albeit an important part) of the entire problem. By itself, lack of access to a reliable
connection can have an impact on using online portals like MyGov and it can severely hamper
with the delivery of distance education.xliii However, the ‘digital access’ issue also involves
access to larger data limits and to improved digital literacy for those outside metropolitan
centres. Efforts to address the divide that focus on connection alone are unlikely to be
successful in closing the digital divide or addressing inequalities in service deliveries.xliv

Helping the professionals who are there do more
Another way in which these shortages can be addressed is by giving the professionals who are
there better scope to support local services needs. As well as interacting with digital services,
changes to the scope of practice could provide substantial gains. This approach can build on
existing knowledge and practices.
For example, in 2013, the Grattan Institute argued that the worst GP gaps could be
addressed through better utilisation of pharmacists and the introduction of physicians
assistants.xlv More recently, Australia’s Rural Health Commissioner has announced the rolling
out of the ‘National Rural Generalist Pathway’ program that aims to extend the training of
rural GPs to include skills in key specialist areas. This program, already underway in
Queensland, aims to provide ‘multi-skilled’ doctors to areas unlikely to attract health
specialists. xlvi In this rollout however, the vital health and social role of rural nurses should not
be overlooked. Nurses and pharmacists in small towns could, for example, be enabled to do
things like give vaccinations, dress wounds and take x-rays. This is already common practice in
small towns where there is no GP or a part-timer.

Reviewing what works
The RAI’s work on service delivery professionals in small Australian towns is ongoing. While this
report looks at how occupational data has changed between 1981 and 2011, it has not
specifically set out to understand what drives these numbers. The RAI is currently undertaking
further work to understand what is ‘behind the numbers’ in this report. This includes exploring
the impact that policy decisions have had on the numbers of service delivery professionals –
policies including the centralising of government services and the marketization or contracting
out of service delivery.

Although government policy shapes the numbers of professionals in small towns, this upcoming
work explores other influential factors as well. These include delivery methods such as the
move to digital services, professional limitations that may restrict the scope of work of some
service delivery professionals and the impact of incentive programs in addressing the
shortages of professionals.
Our first report raises a number of challenging questions for professions, communities and
policy makers. The RAI will explore these in subsequent work, and welcomes contributions from
readers. Some of the questions up for discussion are:
- How effective are incentive schemes for professions in health and education?
- Are incentives what is needed or are there broader issues – e.g. training of rural
doctors?
- Is the scope of professional work in regions (generally broad and applied rather than
narrow and specialist) a turn off for many professionals?
- How important is a live-in presence? Where there is no service professional in a
community (if it relies on FIFO for example), are there continuity and quality of care
issues?
- What’s the link between the presence of health and education professionals, health
and education outcomes? How effective are other delivery modes (e.g. virtual or part
time services? Is the assumption valid that more service professionals in a town = better
access = better health and education? Most people regard it as broadly true but with
virtual technology and increasing DIDO and FIFO models, views are broadening.
- Are there restrictive policies and programs that are impacting on professionals
numbers? For example limitations on the practice roles of GPs, nurses and specialists?
Should nurses (10 times as numerous in small towns) be able to take on low risk tasks
where there is no local GP, for example?
- How effective can service provision alone be when individual responsibility is also very
important in health and education?
- What about service coordination – is scope as important as scale? In health in
particular there is a close connection between private and public employment, and
GPs typically need a minimum population to maintain a Medicare income base.
- Do jurisdictions have minimum service standards in these professions? If so how are they
being monitored and how do they compare?

Conclusion
This report has documented some progress. Some small town communities are more able to
directly access some service delivery professionals in 2011 than they were in 1981.
However, with the exception of police officers, primary school teachers and paramedics,
people in small towns continue to experience less face-to-face access to generalist
professionals than the average Australian. The shortage of dentists, psychologist and
preschool teachers in small towns represent significant gaps, gaps that are widening and that
coincide with significant community service priorities for policy.
With the economic prospects of a town so closely linked to the wellbeing of its community, it is
essential that social, health and educational outcomes are improved. Improving the access of
communities to service delivery professionals will help not only improve outcomes, but also to
build social and human capital that in turn ensures economic resilience and prosperity.
Policy makers need to consider more flexible approaches to improving access to service
delivery professionals in small towns. Although on paper one town may seem just the same as
another, each has unique needs and strengths. Rigid program design that does not adequately
allow for distance, road quality or the complexity of the digital divide is unlikely to improve
outcomes for small town communities.
There are opportunities for policy makers to more directly target access to service delivery
professionals in towns where needs are great by supporting communities to solve their most
pressing local needs. This is an alternative approach to the current preference for subsidising
specific professionals through expensive programs that have mostly raised access only in inner
regional areas that some may consider to be more attractive places to live.
Digital access to specialist services and supporting local professionals to engage in more
diverse professional practice also provide promising ways to overcome these divides. These
mechanisms should complement service delivery professionals within the community rather than
replace them so that small towns can leverage their social capital and build their resilience.

Per-capita rates

Although per-capita access to GPs
improved overall between 1981
and 2011, the rate for small towns
is still well below the Australian
average. In 2011, there were 83
GPs for every 100,000 people in
small towns, compared to a
national rate of 202 per 100,000.
Between 1981 and 2011, remote
small towns had the biggest
improvement in per-capita rates
(from 28 to 109 per 100,000).
Conversely, towns of 2,500 to
5,000 population saw their percapita rate drop from 65 to 23
per 100,000.

Regional presence of service delivery professionals

In 2011, there were slightly more small
towns with a nurse than in 1981.
However; this increase was driven by
inner regional areas.
There were about the same proportion
of outer regional towns with nurses in
1981 and in 2011 but fewer towns in
remote and very remote areas had
nurses in 2011 than 30 years
previously.
2011 Census data records that all

had a nurse in their communities,
however towns under 1,000 recorded
only a modest improvement.

Per-capita access to nurses in small
towns improved between 1981
and 2011. The gap between the
small town rate and the national
average has begun to close.

However, the gap is closing more
quickly for outer regional and

experienced a decline in percapita rates, with 855 nurses per

In 1981, 9 per cent of small towns had

this had fallen to five per cent of small
towns. This decline was seen across all

Where a small town did have a dentist,
they were more likely to have

In 1981, the per-capita rate of
those in small towns was below that
of the Australian average. By
2011, this gap had widened.

Per-capita rates

In 2011, there were 19 dentists
per 100,000 residents of small
towns compared to a national
average of 81 per 100,000.
Rates for small towns in remote

significantly.
The per-capita rate fell across
towns of all sizes, with the largest
decrease in towns between 1,000

In 1981, small towns had higher percapita rates of preschool teachers than
the Australian average. In 2011, not
only had this advantage diminished, but
a gap had opened.
In 2011, the per-capita rate for small

Social Welfare Professionals
Per-capita rates

Although the 2011 per-capita rate
for social welfare professionals rose
for small towns, it remains below the
national rate across all remoteness
categories.
While per-capita rates increased for
outer regional and remote small
towns, it fell for towns in very remote
areas.
Between 1981 and 2011, the percapita rate improved for towns with
populations over 1,000 people, but
fell for towns with fewer residents.

A3: Developmental vulnerability service professionals by remoteness
and town size.
In 2011, small towns in very remote areas have lower per-capita rates with respect to
psychologists and preschool teachers, compared not only to comparable national rates but
also to small towns in other remoteness classifications. Conversely, towns in very remote areas
had better per-capita access to social welfare professionals than outer regional and remote
small towns.

However, when we compare the per-capita rates by town size, two distinct patterns emerge:
•
•

First, towns with populations of over 2,500 have per-capita rates well above those
with populations between 1,000 and 2,500 and under 1,000.
Second, per-capita rates decrease with town size so that towns with smaller
populations have poorer per-capita rates.

A4: Definitions and Data
What we analysed
In our analysis, we defined a small town as a community outside of major metropolitan areas
and with populations between 200 and 5,000 people. We have used the ABS’ Urban Centre
and Locality (UCL) boundaries for our analysis, and have chosen the upper population limit of
5,000 to better focus on the issues of service delivery in small communities as distinct from the
regional level.
While we have tracked a cohort of 1,111 small Australian towns over time beginning 1981,
we have also permitted the entry of new small towns into our study in subsequent Censuses. By
2011, they represented close to 40 per cent of total towns in our cohort, highlighting their
significance in any study of smaller Australian communities.
We tracked people in the service delivery occupations related to health, education, social
welfare, and public safety and emergency services. Table below lists the individual
occupations that feature in the analysis.

Health

General Practitioners (GPs), Nurses, Psychologists, Dentists

Education

Preschool Teachers, Primary School Teachers, Secondary School Teachers

Public Safety and Emergency
Services

Police Officers, Paramedics

Social Welfare

Social Workers and Counsellors

We analysed these occupations in the cohort of small towns, focussing on two key measures:
1. The number of small towns with these professionals working in their communities.
This gave an indication of how many towns had face-to-face access to a professional
who spent most of, if not all, of their time located in that particular town.
2. The per-capital rate of service delivery professionals in a small town compared to
national averages.
This comparison gives us a sense of how these rates of service are tracking against regional
and national trends. We also compared these rates across small towns themselves between
1981 and 2011, to get a sense of how these rates have changed over time.
Census data is ‘confidentialised’ when it reveals small numbers of people (under 5) in certain
categories. This is designed to protect the confidentiality of census data by not allowing
someone to drill into the data to find, for example, the income level of a person in a small
community with a certain occupation. The ABS therefore randomises the numbers if the count is
less than 5 people in a particular category. This means that where the specific counts of
people in small towns are under 5, the numbers may not reflect the actual census responses.

For this reason we report here on trends in professional numbers by small town size and
remoteness classification rather than reporting numbers for each small town itself.

Definition of a ‘small town’
For the purposes of this research, a small town has been defined as a community outside of
metropolitan areas with a population between 200 to 5,000 residents. Following Collits,
(2000) we acknowledge that the definition of a small town has varied both across government
departments and peer-reviewed research.xlvii Notwithstanding this subjectivity, the definition
used in this research is both practical and is consistent with the intention of the research itself.
We concede that the lower limit of 200 excludes some small towns from our analysis.
However, this minimum reflects the constraints on data availability. By selecting the ABS’ Urban
Centre and Locality (UCL) boundaries as the primary measure for our analysis, we have
inherited the population parameters in this initial data collection, including a lower limit of 200
residents. UCL boundaries were preferred because their boundaries clearly differentiate
between individual towns and they remain relatively consistent over time.
The upper population limit of 5,000 population reflects the intention to more keenly
understand the prevalence of service delivery professionals in small communities as distinct
from the regional level.

Available Data
Evaluating the prevalence and per-capita ratios of service delivery professionals across small
Australian towns since 1981 is no small undertaking. While peer-reviewed research provided
a basis for the changing role and the broad effect of policy responses on small towns, it did
not provide specific occupational data.xlviii Consequently, the RAI identified aggregate and
per-capita measures of selected service delivery occupations in UCLs from Census data as far
back as 1981.
While using Census data by UCL provides many advantages, it also provides some
drawbacks. As others have discussed,xlix the rate of non-response to a Census is typically
around 1-2 per cent of Australia’s total population. In addition, the particular Census question
about an individual or household member’s occupation focuses solely on ‘the main job held’,
meaning that full occupation details may not necessarily be captured. Both of these factors
can often contribute to an underestimation of the total workforce.
Further to this, under the ABS UCL classification system, rural areas of state that are adjudged
by the ABS as being external to a particular UCL are categorised under a separate ‘Rural
Balance’ entity. This can sometimes include individuals or households that consider themselves a
part of a nearby town or city but for the purposes of our study, are not. Both of these factors
mean that disaggregation at a regional or town level carries some risk of error. Where
possible, these numbers have been locally verified to mitigate this risk.

Cohort
The list of UCLs that makes up the cohort of small towns at every Census is dynamic. From
Census to census, existing small towns may have fallen below the threshold necessary to
identify them as a town (<200), or grown into Major Towns or Regional Cities, or been
absorbed into metropolitan zones. Additionally, newer communities, as well as those previously
captured in the rural balance category (owing to a recognised population below 200), that
grew into recognised towns in subsequent Censuses (acquiring a unique UCL from the ABS)
have been included in our cohort. This means that over time, the observed cohort of small
towns has grown considerably, with a largely constant group of existing small towns in 1981
joined by a significant number of new entrants.

Remoteness
In our analysis, we filtered towns by remoteness categories using the ABS’ Remoteness Area
classification (Inner Regional, Outer Regional, Remote and Very Remote) to better understand
the impact that remoteness has on the prevalence and per-capita ratios of service delivery
professionals in small towns. This ABS measure is only available for 2001 onward,
complicating comparisons to data before this time. Where possible we have avoided
comparing remoteness before and after 2001 as much as possible. However where this
comparison has been made we have worked on the assumption that no town has increased in
remoteness between 1981 and 2011.
The distribution of small towns across Australia by remoteness classification is shown below.
Most remote and very remote small towns are in Queensland and South Australia, and
Victoria has no very remote small towns.

Occupations Data
Limitations
There are several limitations in using occupational data.
First, the classification of occupations over the period 1981 to 2016 has changed.l These
changes have occurred to the classification of occupations used in this research, disrupting
continuity of observed professions and making time-series comparison more difficult.li For
instance, while Dental Practitioners were considered the single occupation that provided dental
services to the community in the 1981 Census, by 2011, this had expanded to include
Hygienists, Orthodontists, and more. While the ABS recognises these as separate occupations,
for the purposes of our research they are all considered dental service professionals and
needed to be included in our reporting. Efforts have been made to identify and account for
inconsistencies and structural changes in the data so as to preserve the underlying purpose of
our research – recognising professionals who work to provide these basic services to their
community, regardless of the specific title they carry. Notwithstanding these efforts, we
acknowledge that there may be some professionals delivering services that are unintentionally
excluded from the research.
Second, there are concerns that the complexity of health related occupations might not be
fully captured in the Census collection such that some measures in the research might be
overstated. For example, the Census has limited capacity to reflect the itinerant nature of
General Practitioners in small towns. These GPs may base themselves in one particular town
for a given percentage of their time (say for example 0.5 FTE), but also provide outreach
services to other towns on a regular or semi-regular basis. Census data is unlikely to pick up
the services they may provide as outreach, instead attributing their location to one town only.
lii

Nurses
In the 1981 Census, nurses were classified under four separate ISCO codes (023 to 027),
representing anything from Enrolled Nurses, Bush Nurses, those with general or psychiatric
certification, and those still under probation or training. However, by 2011 the ANZSCO list of
occupations involved a far more complicated subdivision of nursing, recognising the growing
certification and training adopted by the profession. For our purposes, Registered Nurses
(ANZSCO 2544) and Enrolled and Mothercraft Nurses (ANZSCO 4114) have both been
included in our research, so as to best meet our definition of nursing in the community and still
ensure continuity with the 1981 definition.
Dentists
In the 1981 Census, dentists were a single ISCO code (022) representing Dental Officers,
Dental Surgeons, Dental Doctors and Orthodontists and other professionals. However, the
ANZSCO list of occupations used in the 2011 Census was split between Dental Practitioners
(ANZSCO 2523) and Dental Hygienists, Technicians and Therapists (ANZSCO 4112). Both
have been included in the 2011 research.

Education
There were two issues with using Census data to identify primary and secondary teachers:
(i)
Narrow employment codes that risk exclusion of some categories of occupation
that nevertheless are involved in the provision of core education services, such as
middle school teachers and special education teachers. However as these
categories were overwhelmingly located within metropolitan areas, the impact on
the analysis was minimal. liii
(ii)
Census data does not reliably capture the fact that education is provided by
parents and guardians trained specifically in primary and secondary education,
yet who may identify as stay-at-home parents. However, as only 0.3per cent of
the total Australian school student population are home schooled, their small
representation does not significantly impact our analysis.liv

xlviii Although remaining broadly consistent over time, the method of determining UCL
boundaries changed in 2011. Prior to 2011, UCLs were formed using the Australian Standard
Geographical Classification (ASGC) Collection Districts (CDs), but from 2011 onward have
been defined using the Australian Standard Geographical Standard (ASGS) SA1 boundaries.
We have pooled UCLs into major groupings such as All Small Towns, Outer Regional Small
Towns, and Remote and Very Remote Small Towns to help mitigate against any inconsistencies
brought on by these changes.

l In 1981, the ABS adhered to the International Labour Office’s International Standard
Classification of Occupations (ISCO). For the period 1986 to 2001, it was the Australian
Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO), and most recently, the Australian and New
Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) has been in use since 2006.
li A useful example is dental services. While in 1981, dental practitioners existed as the sole
available category for occupations we would ascribe to ‘dental’, by 2011 there were Dental
Practitioners, Dental Hygienists, Dental Technicians and Dental Therapists. While in some cases
there is a temptation (and in others, a need) to continue to only include Dental Practitioners to
ensure consistency over time and permit time series analysis, it would fail to accurately capture
the level of dental services being delivered in communities. In many instances like this, a growing
list of professions have needed to be included over time to account for the growing nuance of
the industry, and the changing workforce patterns in Australia.
lii A meaningful example of the shortcomings of census data has been provided in the next
section, drawing heavily on the work of Rural Health Workforce Australia. It demonstrates how

inconsistencies manifest across the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare’s Workforce
data, ABS census data, and Medicare data for a measure like General Practitioners
operating in Australia. While it is acknowledged that census data is found to have several
issues, as discussed above, it also holds a number of advantages over other data for the
purposes of our research, making it the most appropriate in spite of its limitations. As
demonstrated in the Rural Health Workforce Australia’s publication, Regional, Rural and
Remote GP Workforce Trends (RHW, 2014), there are several sources available for
information on Australia’s regional and remote health workforce, and their existence
demonstrates certain limitations with census data.
liii While primary and secondary schooling are typically recognised as separate 4-digit
categories by the ABS (ANZSCO codes 2412 and 2414 respectively in 2011), selecting these
two (to ensure consistency over time) has also meant the exclusion of Middle School Teachers
(2413), Special Education Teachers (2415) and School Teachers nfd (2410, No Further
Details).
Fortunately, all three categories were overwhelmingly located within metropolitan areas (in
the 2011 Census, it was around 94-96% of all professionals) and therefore have minor impact
on our analysis.
