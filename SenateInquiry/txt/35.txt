Dear Sir / Madam
INQUIRY INTO THE INDICATORS OF, AND IMPACT OF, REGIONAL INEQUALITY IN AUSTRALIA
Thank you for providing the Rural City of Murray Bridge with the opportunity to make a
submission on this inquiry.
The Rural City of Murray Bridge is the local government body in South Australia with
responsibility for an area covering 1,832km2 (including portion of the River Murray and Lake
Alexandrina) and includes 975km of trafficable roads (not including those roads maintained
by the South Australian Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure).
Murray Bridge is located approximately 75km from Adelaide and is a major centre on the
Murray River and north of Lake Alexandrina. The total population of the council area is
estimated to be approximately 21,486 people. The city is the centre of a major agricultural,
transport, industrial and tourism district and is the "crown" of the Murray Region, containing
many attractions for people of all ages.
Despite being only 75km from Adelaide, Murray Bridge experiences unique challenges
associated with being a regional location. The attached submission details some of these
issues and contains recommendations to address issues of regional inequality.
Council would be interested in presenting to a public hearing, if one should be held.

Inquiry into the Indicators of, and Impact of, Regional Inequality in Australia
STATISTICAL OVERVIEW
The Rural City of Murray Bridge has commissioned statistical analysis, which indicates that this
region differs significantly from the average in a number of measures when compared with
Greater Adelaide, South Australia and Australia as a whole. This information is contained in
the appendices (See Appendix 1).
The overview reveals, when compared to then national population:
 that the median age of Murray Bridge is older, at 41, than the national level age of 38;
 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population is higher at 4.6 % compared to national
average of 2.8%;
 Couples with children is 23%, lower than the national figure of 30%;
 Median weekly household income is $974, significantly lower compared to $1,431 seen
nationally;
 Households renting stands at 32%, meaning Murray Bridge has a higher proportion of
households who rent than when compared to the average of 29%;
 Households with a mortgage is lower at 29% than the average of 32%;
 Only 15%, but rising, of the population are overseas born compared to the national
average of 26%;
 Only 10% of the population speaks a language other than English at home compared to
21%, but this figure is rising; Only 7% of the population has a university qualification against
22% for the nation;
 23% have a trade qualification against the national average of 19%;
 Unemployment is higher at 8.8%, where the national average is 6.9%; and
 The labour force participation rate at 54% is lower than the Australian average of 60%.
SEIFA INDEX OF DISADVANTAGE
The Rural City of Murray Bridge SEIFA Index of Disadvantage measures the relative level of
socio-economic disadvantage based on a range of Census characteristics. It is a general
view of the relative level of disadvantage in one area compared to others. The index is
derived from attributes that reflect disadvantage such as low income, low educational
attainment, high unemployment, and jobs in relatively unskilled occupations.
The Rural City of Murray Bridge is revealed as highly disadvantaged with a score of 900.6,
with only 6 other areas in South Australia having a lower score out of the 70 areas recorded.
Pockets within the Rural City of Murray Bridge have an index score within the range of 600 to
800.
OVERVIEW OF REGIONAL INEQUALITY
A principal cause of regional inequality arises through the economies of scale. Smaller
populations in regional areas do not provide the level of economic viability to provide the
same level of service that might be available in metropolitan areas.
Economies, whether metropolitan or regional, rely on infrastructure and business investment
to build confidence and grow. The nature of the businesses and strengths of a region will
differ, but the underlying economic theory remains the same.
It is not uncommon for there to be inequalities in opportunities between regional and
metropolitan areas. Most often this seems to manifest itself in opportunities for employment
and education, as well as a lack of access to health care and public transport.
Council acknowledges that in areas with smaller populations it sometimes is not
economically viable to provide the same level for service for an area like health care, so
resources (be they human or mechanical) are more centrally located in denser population
centres, making access by regional persons more difficult.

Regional areas are often the focus of tourism, with the Murray Bridge region being a
significant river based tourism centre. The tax / rate base remains low in line with the
permanent population, but that population can swell with tourists at holiday times who have
an expectation about the level of infrastructure and tourism experiences. Some business
become dependent on tourism for survival and reputational risks can have a significant
impact. The reputation of an area for tourism value can be impacted by many factors
including:





The level of infrastructure (physical, technological etc.) available;
The safety of an area;
The visual amenity; and
Environmental factors (e.g. levels in the River Murray, safety)

Regional areas can also be heavily dependent on one particular industry or employer. A
sudden change to that industry or employer can have a substantial impact on investor,
business and community confidence. This has flow on effects with reputational damage that
can last for an extensive period of time.
The way in which are states are geographically laid out, the nature of economic growth and
government policy, including immigration policy, means infrastructure and business
investment has been concentrated in areas of more dense population. As investment
focuses in these areas, the level of investment in regional areas is less and the divide
between the two continues to grow.
To bridge the divide, a re-focusing of infrastructure and business investment in regional areas,
it is essential that various policy settings are pro-actively implemented. While policy settings
can be stated at a local level, often they are enabled through Commonwealth or State
Government policy and legislation, such as investment assistance and land use and zoning,
and require co-operation at all levels to implement.
Land use and zoning controls must facilitate and enable business growth, but also ensure
new development does not unreasonably encroach on existing. It is not a matter of “freeing
up zoning and reducing red tape”. It is a matter of identifying new areas for economic
growth and devising effective and efficient ways of providing the infrastructure needed to
attract businesses. Zoning must enable growth, but not at expense of good planning. The
current hiatus on planning zone changes in South Australia is hampering growth and
preventing good planning outcomes, particularly in regional areas.
Distance is a significant issue, both positive and negative for regions. A greater distance
between the regional and metropolitan area can be an advantage, if the area is a pleasant
place to live and work. Where distance is such that travel becomes more difficult, it creates
a necessity for the region to be more self-sufficient, driving investment and growth. However,
where services are not available, for example, specialist medical services, distance and time
required away from home and employment is a significant impost on the community and
individuals.
The attraction and retention of large scale businesses drive the growth of regional
economies. Incentives for businesses and skilled migrants to locate in regional areas would
benefit regional economies, while reducing stress on major urban areas. Examples of
incentives could include tax relief, infrastructure provision, visa regulations etc.
Provision of funding for infrastructure investment which drives growth and opportunities is a
valuable policy and fiscal initiative for local government.

TERMS OF REFERENCE:
a) Fiscal policies at federal, state and local government levels;
Rate Capping:
The capping of rates, creating an artificial ceiling on rate rises, is a policy of the State
Government. This policy will introduce an expensive bureaucratic process that will restrict
vital service delivery to the community or, if services are maintained, postpone the
financial burden of today’s services and infrastructure onto future generations.
Rate capping does nothing to address the shifting of costs and responsibilities between
state and local government and the pressure this creates on local government rates.
Due to isolation, there is less potential for regional local government to share services and
so this will impact adversely on services that are able to be delivered and will restrict the
ability to provide non-core services that are needed by the community. Communities are
seeking further services or different delivery modes from local government and this
creates an additional demand on budgets.
Rate-capping interstate has resulted in more red tape and bureaucracy and has
increased administration costs for councils and state government, diverting funds away
from non-core, but required services and resulted in the deterioration of infrastructure.
Councils currently work with communities to develop an annual business plan and
budget. However, rate caps will be determined with no community input. Rate capping
centralises decision making about council rate revenue and shifts accountability from
community representatives to an unelected bureaucracy.
Grants:
If rate capping is introduced into South Australia, regional local governments will
increasingly rely on grants from both state and Commonwealth governments if they are
to provide the services requested of them by their communities.
Service Delivery:
Due to the cost shifting for services historically provided by the state government to local
government level, local government is now delivering a changed focus of service
delivery, without increase in funding to cover costs of these services and limited ability to
increase revenue. A recent example has been the transfer of functions from the
Environment Protection Authority under the Local Nuisance and Litter Control Act 2016
and delegation of certain planning controls from the State Commission Assessment Panel
to Councils.
b) Improved co-ordination of federal, state and local government policies;
State government has transferred responsibility for collecting state government revenue
through the use of Council rate collection, in particular the Natural Resources
Management Levy. Such policy decisions indicate that there are areas where there has
been little co-ordination or consultation with local government in the introduction of
these policies. Regional localities also contribute more in levies than the metropolitan
area.
An exception to the lack of coordination has been the creation of the Murray Bridge
Learning Campus through the Regional Study Hubs Program, developed in response to
the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee Senate Report on
the Future Role and Contribution of Regional Capitals to Australia (November 2016). This
program aims to increase the number of rural and regional students attending tertiary

institutions and has been a positive example of improved co-ordination between levels of
government.
c) Regional development policies;
See comment above regarding Regional Study Hubs Program
Grants application processes can be bureaucratic, time and resource consuming, with
no guarantee of success. Grant processes which incorporate early advice as to
likelihood of success of receiving funding will enable (staged process) enables an
assessment prior to the need for submitting a full business case. The Regional Growth
Fund has adopted this process.
d) Infrastructure;
Physical:
As noted above, the Council area covers 1,832km2 and includes 975km of trafficable
roads, with a population of approximately 21,486 people, the provision of infrastructure is
a significant cost. The community are often required to travel long distances on unsealed
roads or are not in an ideal condition.
The greatest level of investment on infrastructure by the public sector, would appear to
also be targeted in areas of denser population. When regional areas do not equally
share in infrastructure investment they fall behind, resulting sometimes in falling
population growth rates.
Regional bodies do not have the rating (tax) base to provide infrastructure to the same
extent or standard as urban localities, nor the economies of scale that exist there either.
Maintenance of existing infrastructure is tightly controlled and costs can be greatly
increased by one-off natural events. Changing road surfaces from unsealed to sealed is
a major investment and often only possible with joint funding from other levels of
government through grant schemes. Unsealed roads and poor road conditions
contribute to road accidents, injury and death.
A dedicated program to provide a guaranteed level of funding to local government for
road maintenance and construction would assist local government in prioritisation of
infrastructure programs to improve road conditions throughout the council area and so
reduce the costs to the community and health care systems as a result of vehicle
accident.
Telecommunications:
Lack of high speed internet services is a key constraint to business operation and
development, especially for those operations outside of regional urban centres where
they may need to rely on less reliable satellite technology rather than fixed wireless or
wired service delivery.
Community & Government:
Banking & finance services have been removed from many regional centres over time,
and while online services and some mobile services are offered by institutions, ability to
interact on a personal level is desired for more complicated matters.
Government Services from state and Commonwealth levels has reduced over time as
delivery has become more centralised and reliant on online service delivery.

Inquiry into the Indicators of, and Impact of, Regional Inequality in Australia
Health & Medical:
Health & Medical services remain a major issue within regions, Australians living in rural
and remote areas tend to have lower life expectancy, higher rates of disease and injury,
and poorer access to and use of health services than people living in cities. There are
demonstrated higher levels of demand for services surrounding mental and physical
health and rehabilitation services.
Dedicated service centres that comprise essential community services from all levels of
Government and private sector organisations should be developed in regional centres.
Such facilities could be based on a Service SA model which offers a variety of state
Government services, primarily related to financial transactions. However, a regional
facility would be able to offer services such as Centrelink, NDIS, library, local government
services, health clinics and medical specialty room, police, banking and financial
services, state Government services, with these services offered as either dedicated or
scheduled visitation.
e) Education;
The community experiences difficulty in accessing a wide base of secondary subjects,
vocational education and tertiary education facilities.
The creation of the Murray Bridge Learning Campus through the Regional Study Hubs
Program, developed in response to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport
References Committee Senate Report on the Future Role and Contribution of Regional
Capitals to Australia1 (November 2016) offers greater opportunity. This program aims to
increase the number of rural and regional students attending tertiary institutions and has
been a positive example of improved co-ordination between levels of government.
f)

Building human capital;
Regional localities often need to employ managerial and professional staff from outside
that region as there an insufficient local skill base arising from lack of opportunity for
development. However, locally employed staff tend to have a higher degree of loyalty
to the business.
Increased access to educational opportunities will improve growth in human capital, as
will schemes such as Youth Jobs Path designed to provide young people with
employability skills and work experience towards employment.
The presence of universities with commitment to regions and appropriate programs will
aid in growing human capital and a greater self-reliance on the local skills base.

g) Enhancing local workforce skills;
Accessing basic and ongoing vocational skills development has become an increasing
cost for employees and staff as vocational educators, such as TAFE SA, have centralised
course delivery. Changes in delivery of vocational courses, with restriction of providers,
has had an adverse impact on developing local workforce skills. While online delivery has
increased the ability for regional communities to participate in vocational training,
practical skills require hands on training and can be a significant cost to individuals and
business if employees must travel to a metropolitan area to attend training.
Employment arrangements;

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 35

Inquiry into the Indicators of, and Impact of, Regional Inequality in Australia
Attracting and retaining staff, especially professional/ managerial staff for more than a
short period is a major issue, with constant turnover due to location or career
advancement. Murray Bridge is in the situation of being too far from Adelaide to
commute for many, but not far enough to consider relocation or for employers to be
able to offer accommodation as part of a package.
While universities with commitment to regions actively encourage regional placements,
this does not guarantee a long term solution to human capital growth for all sectors.
An extension of tax offset zones to a greater range of regional localities would
encourage attraction and retention of staff and service providers in regional localities.
h) Decentralisation policies;
Government decentralisation is better enabled now through the use of improved
technology. The location of government departments, or branch or back office facilities,
in regional areas has the benefit of creating employment opportunities and
strengthening communities by creating certainty amongst the community through
guaranteed income and spending created by a stable workforce. A prime example is
the location of the Crown Land SA regional office in Berri, South Australia.
Decentralisation provides, as an associated benefit, better growth in human capital,
economies of scale, acts as an attractor to other business, and services, including
education and health by underpinning local economies.
i)

Innovation;
Cities provide key innovation assets with the majority of registered R&D institutions, with
only a minority of regional local government areas having such institutions. Investment
flows to, and R&D strength is concentrated with these institutions.
The existence of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) is a key measure of
emerging regional innovation capacity and is an indicator of a rich and innovative local
business network.
Regional innovation is generally borne out of necessity with cost, distance, expertise
often ruling out standard responses to issues and problems.
Insight Australia’s Regional Competitiveness Index ranks Murray Bridge low on a number
of scores, including innovation. Regional Innovation Centres, delivered through the
Incubator Support initiative, with supporting expertise has the potential to grow
innovation and business expertise and capability to be more competitive. However,
these should be focused on areas with low ranking innovation scores.

j)

Manufacturing;
Manufacturing in regional areas is generally related to engineering, mining and food and
beverage production and are often significant employers of the community. The viability
of many of these businesses will depend on finding niche areas of operation that will
provide them with ongoing market opportunities locally, domestically and export related.
Underpinning the business development of manufacturing enterprise is the ability to gain
access to innovation, export ready programs and employee development programs.

Single adverse issues related to major employers, such as closure of a business or impact
on production, can have a major impact on local communities and economies. The
Thomas Foods International fire in February 2018 has had a major impact on Murray
Bridge’s economy and community, whereas it contributed previously $1bn to the local
and regional economy. This has created uncertainty and impacted on confidence within
the community in relation to employment, finance, housing and income, as well as flow
on effects to suppliers and service providers.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Introduce as standard a process for grant applications which incorporates a less detailed
application and subsequent early advice to the applicant as to likelihood of success of
obtaining funding prior to the need to prepare and submit a full business case as part of
a detailed application.
2. Finance a dedicated program to provide a guaranteed level of funding to regional local
government for road maintenance and construction to improve road conditions.
3. Funding for increased access to practical skills and vocational education within regional
locations with dedicated facilities.
4. Support the creation of dedicated service centres that comprise essential community
services from all levels of Government and private sector organisations to be developed
in regional centres.
5. Extend tax offset zones to a greater range of regional localities to encourage attraction
and retention of staff and service providers in regional localities.
6. Ensure that regional business is able to access export development programs to bring
business to export ready level.
7. Fund innovation programs for those areas with low levels of innovation as defined by the
Regional Competitiveness Index.

Settlement history
European settlement dates from the 1830s, with land used mainly for pastoral purposes. Population was minimal until
1879 when a road bridge was constructed over the Murray River. The township of Murray Bridge was laid out in 1883,
developing as a port along the Murray River. Growth took place during the 1880s and 1890s, spurred by the opening of
the Adelaide-Melbourne railway line in 1886, growth in farming and industry, and the development of irrigation.
Population growth continued into the 1930s, aided by land reclamation and irrigation. Expansion occurred during the
1970s and 1980s, mainly within the urban centre of Murray Bridge, with the population of the City rising from under
9,000 in 1961 to over 15,000 in 1986. The population gradually increased from the mid 1990s, rising from under 16,000
in 1996 to about 19,500 in 2011, with most of this growth occurring in the township of Murray Bridge. Growth is
expected in the future, largely from the mixed use development south of the township at Gifford Hill.

Population and dwellings
There are a number of different ways of measuring the population of an area, all of which give an insight into the
size of the place and its rate of growth over different time periods. The Census counts people where they are on
the night of the Census (enumerated population) and also by where they usually live (usual residence). Both these
populations are useful and form the basis for a range of characteristics collected in the Census.
However, the most accurate count of the total population is Estimated Resident Population, which factors in an
estimate of those missed in the Census and those who were overseas on Census night. It is usually higher than
either Census count, and is also updated annually after the Census, providing preliminary estimates for up to 5
years.
This page provides the three population counts for the Rural City of Murray Bridge at the last Census, with

Rural City of
Murray Bridge
Estimated Resident Population (ERP)
The Estimated Resident Population is the OFFICIAL Rural City of Murray Bridge population for 2016. For areas
within the Rural City of Murray Bridge, the ERP is not an official count but an experimental estimate which is
subject to review after the next Census.
Populations are counted and estimated in various ways. The most comprehensive population count available in
Australia is derived from the Census of Population and Housing conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
every five years. However the Census count is generally an under-estimate of the actual population, due to
people missed in the Census and people overseas on Census night. To provide a more accurate population
figure which is updated more frequently than every five years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics also produces
"Estimated Resident Population" (ERP) numbers for the Rural City of Murray Bridge. Estimates for areas within
the Rural City of Murray Bridge are based on aggregates of SA1s derived from population distributions applicable
at the 2011 Census. Actual populations may vary slightly where population growth has not been uniform since the
previous Census.
See data notes for a detailed explanation of different population types, how they are calculated and when to use
each one.

the Rural City of Murray Bridge's disability statistics relate directly to need for assistance due to a severe or
profound disability. The information may be used in the planning of local facilities, services such as day-care and
occasional care and in the provision of information and support to carers. the Rural City of Murray Bridge's
disability statistics help in understanding the prevalence of people who need support in the community, and along
with information on Unpaid Care to a person with a disability, how that support is provided.
Please note: A person's reported need for assistance is based on a subjective assessment and should therefore
be treated with caution. See the specific data notes for further detail.
Due to changes in ABS rules concerning perturbation and additivity of data to protect the confidentiality of
individuals in 2016, counts of individual age groups with a need for assistance in 2016 may not add up to the
table total. The table total is independently calculated and will be closer to the true population requiring
assistance. Due to ABS adjustments of small numbers, no reliability can be placed on small data cells in 2016.

Individual income quartiles
The Rural City of Murray Bridge's income statistics are an indicator of socio-economic status. With other data
sources, such as Household Income, Qualifications and Occupation, they help tell the story of the area's economic
opportunities and socio-economic status. Individual income levels are not comparable over time because of the
influences of economic change such as wage level fluctuations and inflation. The income quartile method is the most
objective method of comparing change in the income profile of a community over time.
A detailed explanation of how Individual Income quartiles are calculated and interpreted is available in specific data
notes.

Household income
Households form the common 'economic unit' in our society. the Rural City of Murray Bridge's Household Income
is one of the most important indicators of socio-economic status. With other data sources, such as Qualifications
and Occupation, it helps to reveal the economic opportunities and socio-economic status of the Rural City of
Murray Bridge. It is important to note that income data is not necessarily a measure of wealth. For example, if an
area has a large number of retirees this will produce a higher proportion of households with low income but the
retirees may have large capital wealth. For this reason, household income should be viewed in conjunction with
Age and Household Composition.
The incomes presented on this page are for the latest Census year only. For comparison of incomes over time,
go to Household Income Quartiles.

Equivalised household income
While Household Income is a useful measure, it is difficult to tell if changes over time and between geographic areas
are due to actual changes in income levels, or due to changes in household size and composition. For example, an
increase in lower income households could be due to job losses in key economic sectors, or simply due to decreasing
household size as adult children leave home.
Equivalised Household Income puts all households on an equal footing independent of household size and
composition to enable a true comparison between areas and over time. It is an indicator of the income resource
available to a household of standard size and is the best measure of the changing economic fortunes of households
living in the Rural City of Murray Bridge.
A detailed explanation of how Equivalised Household Income quartiles are calculated and interpreted is available in
specific data notes.

Households with children
Households with Children require different services and facilities than other household types, and their needs change
as both adults and children age. When many families in an area are at the same stage in their individual lifecycles, it
creates a suburb lifecycle. Knowing where a suburb is in a cycle of change helps planners make evidence-based
decisions about the demand for services both now and in the future.
For Households with Children in the Rural City of Murray Bridge, life stage is based on the age of children in the
household. The age of the parent(s) is not taken into account.
Young children: Children aged under 15 only
Mixed age children: One or more children under 15 and one or more children over 15 (must have 2 or more children)
Older children: Children aged 15 and over only

Households without children
Households without Children include couples without children and lone person households. They require different
services depending on the age of the people in the households. For example young couples who have not had
children (yet) compared to older "empty nester" couples whose children may have left home.
For Households without Children in the Rural City of Murray Bridge, life stage is based on the age of the household
reference person (usually person 1 on the Census form):
Young: Aged 15-44
Middle-aged: Aged 45-64
Older: Aged 65 and over

To continue building the story, the Rural City of Murray Bridge's Household data should be viewed in conjunction with
Household Size, Age Structure and Dwelling Type.

Household size
The size of households in general follows the life-cycle of families. Households are usually small at the stage of
relationship formation (early marriage), and then increase in size with the advent of children. They later reduce in size
again as these children reach adulthood and leave home. Household size can also be influenced by a lack (or
abundance) of affordable housing. Overseas migrants and indigenous persons often have a tradition of living with
extended family members which significantly affects household size.
Household size in Australia has declined since the 1970s but between 2006 and 2016, the average household size
remained stable for the nation as a whole.
An increasing household size in an area may indicate a lack of affordable housing opportunities for young people, an
increase in the birth rate or an increase in family formation in the area. A declining household size may indicate
children leaving the area when they leave home, an increase in retirees settling in the area, or an attraction of young
singles and couples to the area.
For greater insight, the Rural City of Murray Bridge's Household Size data should be viewed in conjunction with
Household Summary, Age Structure, Dwelling Type, Household Income and Language Spoken at Home.

Dwelling type
Dwelling Type is an important determinant of the Rural City of Murray Bridge's residential role and function. A greater
concentration of higher density dwellings is likely to attract more young adults and smaller households, often renting.
Larger, detached or separate dwellings are more likely to attract families and prospective families. The residential built
form often reflects market opportunities or planning policy, such as building denser forms of housing around public
transport nodes or employment centres.
Dwelling Type statistics should be viewed in conjunction with Household Size, Household Types, Housing Tenure and
Age Structure for a more complete picture of the housing market in the Rural City of Murray Bridge.

Number of bedrooms per dwelling
The Number of Bedrooms in a dwelling is an indicator of the size of dwellings, and when combined with Dwelling Type
information, provides insight into the role the Rural City of Murray Bridge plays in the housing market. For example, an
area of high density dwellings that are predominantly 1-2 bedroom are likely to attract students, single workers and
young couples, whereas a high density area with dwellings that are predominantly 2-3 bedroom may attract more
empty nesters and some families.
In combination with Household Type and Household Size, the Number of Bedrooms can also indicate issues around
housing affordability, overcrowding and other socio-economic factors.

Internet connection
An internet connection is now an important utility for most households in Australia. It is increasingly required for
accessing essential information and taking part in the digital economy. Australia-wide in 2016, nearly 80% of all
households had internet access. However, this decreases with age – seniors are less likely to have internet access at
home. The lack of internet access is likely to indicate a level of disadvantage and could be related to socio-economic
factors, age, or geographical isolation.
Internet connectivity in the Rural City of Murray Bridge should be looked at in conjunction with Household Type and
Age Structure, as well as Education Levels.

Number of cars per household
The ability of the population to access services and employment is strongly influenced by access to transport. The
number of motor vehicles per household in the Rural City of Murray Bridge quantifies access to private transport and
will be influenced by Age Structure and Household Type, which determine the number of adults present; access to
Public Transport; distance to shops, services, employment and education; and Household Income. Depending on
these factors, car ownership can be seen as a measure of advantage or disadvantage, or a neutral socio-economic
measure, which impacts on the environment and quality of life.

Housing tenure
The Rural City of Murray Bridge's Housing Tenure data provides insights into its socio-economic status as well as the
role it plays in the housing market. For example, a high concentration of private renters may indicate a transient area
attractive to young singles and couples, while a concentration of home owners indicates a more settled area with
mature families and empty-nesters (Household Summary). Tenure can also reflect built form (Dwelling Type), with a
significantly higher share of renters in high density housing and a substantially larger proportion of home-owners in
separate houses, although this is not always the case.
In conjunction with other socio-economic status indicators in the Rural City of Murray Bridge, Tenure data is useful for
analysing housing markets, housing affordability and identifying public housing areas.

Housing loan repayments
Mortgage repayments are directly related to house prices in the Rural City of Murray Bridge, length of occupancy and
the level of equity of home owners. When viewed with Household Income data it may also indicate the level of housing
stress households in the community are under. In mortgage belt areas it is expected that households will be paying a
higher proportion of their income on their housing compared to well-established areas. First home buyer areas are also
likely to have larger mortgages than upgrader areas where households move in with equity from elsewhere. Mortgage
payment levels are not directly comparable over time because of inflation. For comparison of mortgage payments over
time, go to Housing Loan Quartiles.

Housing rental payments
Rental payments can be a better measure of the cost of housing in the Rural City of Murray Bridge than mortgage
repayments because they are not contingent on length of occupancy or equity in the dwelling.
High rental payments may indicate desirable areas with mobile populations who prefer to rent, or a housing shortage,
or gentrification. Low rental payments may indicate public housing (check Tenure Type), or areas where low income
households move by necessity for a lower cost of living.
Rental payments are not directly comparable over time because of inflation. For comparison of rental payments over
time, go to Housing Rental Quartiles.

Migration summary
In the Rural City of Murray Bridge, a similar rate of people did not change address (52.7%), while a similar rate
(33.5%) moved from elsewhere in Australia, and a lower rate (4.7%) moved from overseas. A total of 3,333
people, or 50.5% of those who moved within Australia, moved within the Rural City of Murray Bridge.
Migration, or residential mobility, together with births and deaths are significant components of population change in
Australia. Migration is the most volatile component of population change and can be affected by changing housing
and economic opportunities such as housing affordability issues or the mining boom. The three main types of
migration are overseas migration, interstate migration and within-state migration, of which within-state is the most
common and largely involves moves between neighbouring areas within an urban or regional setting.
Looking at the level and type of migration in the Rural City of Murray Bridge can indicate whether the population is
sedentary and likely to be in the area for a long time (and perhaps have significant ties to the community), or transient,
and likely to move on. Related topics which can be viewed to get a clearer picture of population mobility include Age
Structure (young adults are likely to move more often) and Housing Tenure (generally renters move more often while
home ownership indicates a more stable population).
This table shows the broad trends of movement between the Rural City of Murray Bridge and the states/territories of
Australia, and from overseas over the 5 years from 2011-2016. For more detail on local movements within the state,
please refer to the Migration by age by location page.

Migration by age
The age structure of people who move into and out of the Rural City of Murray Bridge is strongly influenced by the
residential role and function of the area and can influence demand for particular services. For instance, inner city areas
near employment, education and entertainment tend to attract many young people in their late teens and early
twenties, who move out in their late twenties and thirties to start families in suburban areas. Rural areas tend to lose
young people and gain older families and retirees.
Understanding the Rural City of Murray Bridge's attraction to different age groups helps to plan services for the
community as well as advocating with other levels of government and private enterprise to provide infrastructure,
employment opportunities and facilities which may help to retain age groups which are otherwise leaving the area.

Residential building approvals
The Rural City of Murray Bridge's building approvals are used as a leading indicator of the general level of
residential development, economic activity, employment and investment. Residential building activity depends
on many factors that vary with the state of the economy including interest rates, availability of mortgage funds,
government spending, and business investment. Large financial changes or shocks, such as the Global
Financial Crisis of 2008/09 can be observed in the data. However, the number of building approvals can
fluctuate substantially from year to year simply as a result of the short-term nature of many construction
projects, and the cyclical nature of the industry.

SEIFA by Local Government Area
The Rural City of Murray Bridge SEIFA Index of Disadvantage measures the relative level of socio-economic
disadvantage based on a range of Census characteristics. It is a good place to start to get a general view of
the relative level of disadvantage in one area compared to others and is used to advocate for an area based
on its level of disadvantage.
The index is derived from attributes that reflect disadvantage such as low income, low educational attainment,
high unemployment, and jobs in relatively unskilled occupations. When targeting services to disadvantaged
communities, it is important to also look at these underlying characteristics as they can differ markedly between
areas with similar SEIFA scores and shed light on the type of disadvantage being experienced.
A higher score on the index means a lower level of disadvantage. A lower score on the index means a higher
level of disadvantage.
Please note that the LGAs listed here relate to the boundary which was current at the 2016 Census. Boundary
changes since that time will not be reflected in the list. For recent boundary changes in the local area please

Rural City of Murray Bridge
SEIFA by profile area
The Rural City of Murray Bridge SEIFA Index of Disadvantage measures the relative level of socio-economic
disadvantage based on a range of Census characteristics. It is a good place to start to get a general view of
the relative level of disadvantage in one area compared to others and is used to advocate for an area based
on its level of disadvantage.
The index is derived from attributes that reflect disadvantage such as low income, low educational attainment,
high unemployment, and jobs in relatively unskilled occupations. When targeting services to disadvantaged
communities, it is important to also look at these underlying characteristics as they can differ markedly between
areas with similar SEIFA scores and shed light on the type of disadvantage being experienced.
A higher score on the index means a lower level of disadvantage. A lower score on the index means a higher
level of disadvantage.
The percentile column indicates the approximate position of this small area in a ranked list of Australia’s
suburbs and localities. It’s meant to give an indication of where the area sits within the whole nation. A higher
number indicates a higher socio-economic status. For instance, a percentile of 72 indicates that approximately
72% of Australia’s suburbs have a SEIFA index lower than this area (more disadvantaged), while 28% are
higher.

Rural City of Murray Bridge
About the community profile
Demographic change across Australia is recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in the Census
collections every five years. Population experts, .id, analyse and convert these raw figures into stories of place to
inform council staff, community groups, investors, business, students and the general public.
The Rural City of Murray Bridge Community Profile provides demographic analysis for the Rural City and its suburbs
based on results from the 2016, 2011, 2006, 2001, 1996 and 1991 Censuses of Population and Housing. The profile is
updated with population estimates when the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) releases new figures such as the
annual Estimated Resident Population (ERP).
Suburb boundaries and Census questions change over time, but .id manages the data to ensure that there is an
accurate time series provided for the current geographic boundaries. You can read more about this in the Geography
Notes section.
Results for the Rural City of Murray Bridge include population, age structure, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, income,
qualifications, occupations, employment, unemployment, disability, disadvantage, volunteering, childcare, family
structure, household structure, housing tenure, mortgage and rental payments, and the size and type of the dwellings
people live in.
The Community Profile presents this information in clear maps, tables and charts with concise factual commentary to
answer three important questions:
1. What are the characteristics of the people who live here?
2. How are they changing?
3. How do they compare to other areas?

This provides the basis for making evidence-based decisions about how to provide services for the community as it
changes.
You can be confident about the quality of the information as it is derived from Australian Bureau of Statistics data,
analysed and presented by population experts and funded by the Rural City of Murray Bridge.
