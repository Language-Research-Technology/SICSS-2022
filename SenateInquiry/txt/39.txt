Submission 39

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the
Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into the indicators and impact of regional inequality
in Australia.
The Australian resources sector makes a significant contribution to growth, incomes and
employment in regional Australia. Resources companies employ approximately 220,000 people in
high-wage, high-skilled jobs, predominantly in remote and regional Australia. Average earnings in
the resources sector are around $140,000 a year, more than 60 per cent higher than the average
for all industries.
The Australian resources sector can pay high wages because it is – as the Productivity Commission
has noted – a global leader in technological innovation and one of the most productive industries in
the world. Research by Treasury confirms that more productive businesses pay markedly higher
average real wages and have more capital per worker. Treasury also found that average real wages
are higher in exporting businesses and in businesses with foreign shareholders.
The Australian resources sector uses sophisticated production techniques and highly skilled labour to
transform natural endowments into valuable exports. The resources sector generates more export
revenue for Australia than all other industries combined. According to the Australian Bureau of
Statistics, resources exports (including minerals, metals and petroleum) reached a record high of
$207 billion in calendar 2017, accounting for 53 per cent of total exports.
Iron ore and coal remain Australia’s two most valuable exports, contributing $63 billion and $57 billion
respectively in 2017. In the same year, gold – Australia’s fourth largest export industry – generated
$18 billion in revenue, while base metals contributed a further $25 billion in export earnings.
In its study report on transitioning regional economies, the Productivity Commission made a number
of critical findings that should inform policymakers at all levels of government:
•

Mining has made Australians substantially better off and will continue to do so

•

The expansion of Australia’s mining industry has led to higher average incomes, larger profits
and increased revenues for federal and state governments

•

Mining regions have generally had the highest rates of employment growth (from 2005) and
mining employment is more than double what it was prior to the mining investment boom

•

Incomes in mining regions grew rapidly during the investment phase of the mining boom and
average personal income remains higher in mining regions than other parts of Australia

•

Many mining regions continue to perform well and will likely experience economic and
employment gains for decades to come, irrespective of commodity cycles

•

A mobile workforce – whether fly-in, fly-out or drive-in, drive-out – spreads the benefits of
mining to non-mining regions, particularly cities

•

Removing unnecessary impediments to business and employment is a ‘win-win’ policy that all
governments should pursue to encourage regional growth and development.

The Productivity Commission’s conclusions are consistent with a report by Deloitte Access Economics
(commissioned by the MCA) on the combined economic contribution of mining and mining equipment,
technology and services (METS). The report found that the total economic contribution of Australia’s
mining and METS sector was $236.8 billion in 2015-16 – equivalent to around 15 per cent of
Australia’s gross domestic product (GDP).
Mining and METS activities support 484,100 full-time-equivalent jobs directly and a further 655,700
indirectly – amounting to approximately 10 per cent of total employment.

Submission 39

While the benefits of mining and METS activities are distributed across Australia, there are a number
of regional areas where the sector makes a particularly significant economic contribution:
•

The Pilbara region (WA), with a total economic contribution of $37.8 billion (88 per cent of
total regional economic activity) and 93,800 jobs (direct and indirect)

•

The Bowen-Surat region (Queensland), with a total economic contribution of $18.6 billion (63
per cent of total regional economic activity) and 99,700 jobs (direct and indirect)

•

The Hunter region (NSW), with a total economic contribution of $15.2 billion (34 per cent of
total regional economic activity) and 93,600 jobs (direct and indirect).

In addition, Deloitte Access Economics estimated the total economic contribution of mining and METS
to Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory in 2015-16:
•

Victoria – $13.6 billion in value added (4 per cent of total state activity) and 121,700 jobs

•

South Australia – $8.9 billion in value added (8 per cent of total state activity) and 69,800 jobs

•

Northern Territory – $3.2 billion (10 per cent of total Territory activity) and 23,500 jobs.

Further, individual mining companies make significant contributions to the economies and
communities of particular regions, including by:
•

Purchasing goods and services from a range of local businesses

•

Providing training to apprentices and graduates, as well as scholarships for tertiary education

•

Running leadership and mentoring programs for Indigenous Australians

•

Donating funds to hospitals and schools

•

Partnering with environmental groups to undertake scientific research and conservation

•

Supporting charities, community groups and volunteering.

A number of case studies are provided in this submission.
The Australian mining industry helps to fund essential government services and public infrastructure
by contributing strongly to government revenues. According to Deloitte Access Economics, Australian
minerals companies paid $185 billion in company tax and royalties in the 11 years to 2015-16. At the
same time, the Productivity Commission has confirmed in successive reports that Australian mining
receives ‘negligible’ assistance from government.
Australian mining companies operate in a global industry where prices are highly transparent and
there is intense competition from foreign commodity producers. Policies and regulations can greatly
help or hinder the mining industry’s cost competitiveness, productivity and capacity to adapt to
changing market conditions.
The MCA agrees with the Productivity Commission that industry diversification should not be pursued
as an end in itself, and that all regional communities would benefit from removing regulatory obstacles
to market opportunities and entrepreneurship.
Streamlining project approvals and modernising workplace relations are key structural reform
priorities for the Australian minerals industry. The Productivity Commission estimated in October
2017 that adopting its 2013 proposals to improve major project assessment processes would reduce
project delays and save the economy approximately $240 million. The Productivity Commission also
estimated that implementing its 2015 recommendations for workplace relations reform would add
$850 million a year to the Australian economy.
The following policy checklist is aimed at generating and sustaining higher economic growth and
better living standards in all regions across Australia.

Recommendations
National
The MCA submits that the Australian Government can help to reduce regional inequality by:
Project approvals and environnmental regulation
•

Streamlining state and federal approval processes while maintaining environmental protection

•

Preventing unmeritorious legal challenges to approved projects

•

Removing the duplicative water trigger for coal seam gas and large coal developments

•

Removing uranium mining, milling, decommissioning and rehabilitation from the nuclear
trigger in the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act)

•

Improving the efficiency of environmental assessment and approvals processes by:
-

Setting information requirements to manage clearly defined risks

-

Increased use of alternative assessment mechanisms

-

Coordinating environmental offset requirements between federal and state
governments.

Workplace relations
•

Confining permitted content in enterprise agreements to direct employment matters

•

Refocusing adverse action provisions to discourage unreasonable claims

•

Rebalancing union right-of-entry provisions to prevent unwarranted disruptions to operations

•

Reforming greenfields agreements to encourage investment in new projects

•

Allowing high-income earners to enter into individual agreements.

Taxation
•

Reducing Australia’s internationally uncompetitive corporate tax rate

•

Maintaining the Fuel Tax Credit scheme and the immediate deductibility of exploration
expenditure

•

Preserving the research and development (R&D) tax incentive in its current form and not
restricting eligibility on the basis of industry, firm size, R&D intensity or any other arbitrary
criterion.

Energy and climate change
•

Ensuring that energy and climate change policies:
-

Are nationally coordinated and recognise the energy and resources-intensive nature of
the Australian economy

-

Allow least-cost CO2 emissions abatement, including through access to international
offsets

-

Embody a technology-neutral approach that does not discriminate against nuclear power,
high-efficiency, low-emission coal generation, or carbon capture and storage

-

Reduce energy costs in Australia by securing an energy supply that is reliable, low cost,
dispatchable, available 24/7, and consistent with Australia’s emissions reduction targets.

Minerals Council of Australia | 3

Submission 39

Free trade and open investment
•

Maintaining an open economy by supporting free trade and attracting international
investment.

Deregulation and competition policy
•

Pursuing a comprehensive deregulation agenda that:
-

Considers non-regulation options for achieving policy objectives

-

Ensures any new regulations are efficient, in that they:

•



Proceed from an established case for regulatory action



Enshrine the best (or least worst) of available options



Set unambiguous objectives that do not overlap



Manage risks proportionately rather than prescriptively

Minimises the existing stock of regulation.

Liberalising coastal shipping by:
-

Introducing a single permit system allowing unrestricted trade for both domestic and
foreign vessels

-

Ensuring that Australian and foreign-registered vessels are subject to the same
conditions of access and operation by removing the ability of domestic ships to contest
voyages proposed by foreign ships.

Skills and training
•

Noting the Productivity Commission’s finding that fly-in, fly-out and drive-in, drive-out
arrangements have been instrumental in alleviating skill shortages and spreading the benefits
of the mining boom, the MCA does not support any further changes to existing labour mobility
regulations and programs.

•

The MCA concurs with the Productivity Commission that streamlining occupational licensing
rules across jurisdictions would improve labour mobility. The MCA recommends simplifying
the mutual recognition process under the Mutual Recognition Act 1992, so people holding a
licence in one jurisdiction are entitled to a licence in all jurisdictions, rather than being
required to obtain a separate license for each jurisdiction.

•

The MCA broadly supports the findings of the Productivity Commission's Migrant Intake into
Australia report. The MCA in particular agrees that policy changes that affect skilled
migration should be informed by evidence based and consider the appropriate mix and
influence of economic, social and environmental factors. Accordingly, the MCA considers that
some of the conditions of the Temporary Skill Shortage visa (compared to the 457 visa) will
restrict the mining industry’s access to skilled employees and hinder its competitiveness.

Victoria
The MCA submits that the Victorian Government can help reduce regional inequality by:
•

Designating the minerals industry as a priority sector for attracting investment and facilitating
projects

•

Reducing unnecessary delays in project approvals by improving the efficiency of development
processes and enhancing coordination between agencies

•

Assisting councils in strategic land-use planning, building on the Council of Australian
Governments (COAG) Multi-Land Use Planning Framework

Minerals Council of Australia | 4

Submission 39

•

Removing restrictions on the development of Victoria's resources, including lignite but also
conventional and unconventional gas.

Northern Territory
The MCA submits that the Northern Territory Government can help reduce regional inequality by:
•

Not discouraging mining investment by imposing a new ad valorem royalty regime (a uniform
percentage of the value of product sold) on top of the existing profits-based system

•

Broadening strategic land-use approaches that consider landholder and industry interests to
maximise benefits from multiple land uses

•

Modernising the current security bond system to accept a broader range of forms (e.g.,
insured bonds) to reduce bond sizes in line with progressive rehabilitation and demonstrated
strong environmental performance of operators

•

Working with the NT mining industry work to secure Commonwealth funding to improve public
and transport infrastructure through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (for
concessional loans) and other initiatives to increase the attractiveness of the Northern
Territory to investors and unlock further growth in regional and remote locations

•

Collaborating with industry to raise public awareness of the contribution of mining to the
Territory.

1. CONTRIBUTION OF MINING TO NATIONAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIES
•

The Australian resources sector employs approximately 220,000 people in high-wage, highskilled jobs, predominantly in remote and regional Australia. The Australian resources sector
generates more export revenue than all other industries combined ($207 billion in calendar
2017) and pays the highest wages (around $140,000 a year on average).

•

In its study report on transitioning regional economies, the Productivity Commission
concluded that mining regions have generally had the highest rates of employment growth
and continue to have higher average personal income than non-mining regions.

•

The MCA agrees with the Productivity Commission that removing unnecessary regulatory
impediments to business and employment is a ‘win-win’ policy that all governments should
pursue to encourage regional growth and development.

National economic contribution of mining
The Australian resources sector makes a significant contribution to growth, incomes and
employment in regional Australia. Resources companies employ approximately 220,000 people in
high-wage, high-skilled jobs, predominantly in remote and regional Australia. Average earnings in
the resources sector are around $140,000 a year, more than 60 per cent higher than the average
1
for all industries.
The Australian resources sector pays high wages because it highly innovative and productive.
A November 2017 working paper by Treasury concluded that:
An examination of wage growth by business characteristics using the Business Longitudinal Analysis
Data Environment (BLADE) suggests that higher-productivity businesses pay higher real wages and
employees at these businesses have also experienced higher real wage growth. Larger businesses
(measured by turnover) tend to be more productive, pay higher real wages and have higher real wage
growth. Capital per worker appears to be a key in differences in labour productivity and hence real
2
wages between businesses, with more productive businesses having higher capital per worker.

Further, Treasury found that average real wages are higher in exporting businesses (which tend to be
3
more productive) and in businesses with foreign shareholders (which tend to be larger).
The Productivity Commission has noted that whereas the potential productivity of most Australian
industries is determined by technological progress in other countries, Australia’s resources sector is a
4
global leader and one of the most productive industries in the world.
The Australian resources sector uses sophisticated production techniques and highly skilled labour to
transform natural endowments into valuable exports. The resources sector generates more export
revenue for Australia than all other industries combined. Even with lower commodity prices,
resources exports have remained at very high levels owing to the growth in volumes (Chart 1
overleaf). Over the past five years, the resources sector experienced production increases of 73
per cent for iron ore, 20 per cent for coal, 16 per cent for bauxite and 13 per cent for gold.
In its study report on transitioning regional economies, the Productivity Commission affirmed that:
Overall, Australia has benefited substantially (and will continue to benefit) from the resources boom. It has
led to higher average incomes for individuals, larger profits, and increased revenues for the Australian, State
5
and Territory governments.

The commission cited analysis by economists at the Reserve Bank of Australia, which revealed that
the first ten years of the mining boom:
•

Raised average real wages by 6 per cent

•

Increased per capita household disposable income by 13 per cent

•

Lowered the unemployment rate by approximately 1.25 percentage points.

The Productivity Commission also observed that:
•

‘Regions whose economic base is large scale mining have generally had the highest rates of
7
growth in employment (from 2005), notwithstanding the end of the investment boom.’

•

‘[T]he number of people now employed in mining is more than double what it was prior to the
8
boom.’

•

‘Workers in resource-based regions (mining, oil and gas production) had, on average, higher
9
income growth than in other regions during the mining investment boom.’

•

‘Mean personal income is generally higher in mining-intensive regions than in other parts of
10
the country.’

‘Many resource regions have continued to perform well since the end of the mining
investment boom, although differences in employment patterns are emerging across
11
regions.’

Further, the commission concluded that:
Regions (such as the Pilbara) that have a comparative advantage in markets for minerals and commodities
have benefited from significant investments in new projects and expansions during the investment boom.
This will likely provide an economic and employment base in these regions for decades to come, largely
12
irrespective of commodity market cycles.

The Productivity Commission found that workers who fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) or drive-in, drive-out (DIDO)
spread the benefits of mining to non-mining regions, particularly cities (section 2).
The commission’s findings on the economic contribution of mining and policy priorities for growth are
13
consistent with those of a 2017 report by Deloitte Access Economics (Box 1).
Box 1: Mining and METS sector accounts for 15 per cent of Australia’s GDP
In a report commissioned by the MCA, Deloitte Access Economics estimated the combined economic
contribution of mining and mining equipment, technology and services (METS).
The economic contribution of an industry is the value of its output minus the value of inputs used in
production. Accordingly, the economic contribution of an industry must be distinguished from its total
revenue and total exports, which do not discount inputs supplied by other industries or economies.
Deloitte revealed that the total economic contribution of Australia’s mining and METS sector was
$236.8 billion in 2015-16 – equivalent to around 15 per cent of the Australia’s GDP. The average
dollar of revenue from the mining and METS sector contributed 48 cents directly to the Australian
economy and 37 cents indirectly.
Mining and METS activities support 484,100 full-time-equivalent jobs directly and a further 655,700
indirectly – amounting to approximately 10 per cent of total employment.
It is important to note that Deloitte took a conservative approach to avoid overstating the sector’s
significance. Mining includes exploration, minerals extraction and metal refining, but excludes oil and
gas. The METS sector only comprises industries that are heavily focused on supplying to the mining
industry and excludes generic suppliers.
While the benefits of mining and METS activities are distributed across Australia, there are a number
of regions where the sector makes a particularly significant economic contribution:
•

The Pilbara region (WA), with a total economic contribution of $37.8 billion (88 per cent of
total regional economic activity) and 93,800 jobs (direct and indirect)

•

The Bowen-Surat region (Queensland), with a total economic contribution of $18.6 billion (63
per cent of total regional economic activity) and 99,700 jobs (direct and indirect)

•

The Hunter region (NSW), with a total economic contribution of $15.2 billion (34 per cent of
total regional economic activity) and 93,600 jobs (direct and indirect).

Deloitte further points out that Australia’s comparative advantage in mining and METS not only hinges
on innovation; it also depends on policies that strengthen competition, support the accumulation of
14
skills and capital, and enable firms to respond flexibly to changing market conditions.

Importance of trade for regional Australia
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, resources exports (including minerals, metals and
petroleum) reached a record high of $207 billion in calendar year 2017, accounting for 53 per cent of
15
Australia’s total exports of goods and services. Minerals and energy commodities are Australia’s
largest source of export earnings – twice the value of services exports and four times the value of
farm and other rural goods exports in 2017.
Iron ore and coal remain Australia’s two most valuable exports, contributing $63 billion and $56 billion
in export earnings in 2017 (respectively). Approximately 95 per cent of Australia’s iron ore production
16
and almost all metallurgical coal production is exported. Gold exports generated $18.3 billion, while
17
base metals contributed a further $25 billion in export earnings.
Australia also has a world-class METS sector. The importance of mining in our economy means that
thousands of METS businesses in regional Australia and state capitals have emerged to support and
supply the mining industry. These businesses cover a wide spectrum of activities including
exploration and geoscientific services, mining equipment and supplies, the development of new or
significantly improved technologies, data analysis and software solutions, and professional, financial,
legal and business services to the mining industry.
Exporting businesses especially benefit regional Australia. A February 2017 research paper by the
Department of Industry, Innovation and Science concluded that companies that export overseas, on
average, have 23.8 per cent higher levels of employment compared to non-exporting companies.
These employees earned on average 11.5 per cent more than employees from non-exporting
companies. And when these companies exported every year, their wages grew a further 3.1
18
percentage points to 7.4 per cent.
Owing to their access to both domestic and internationals markets, exporters tend to have more
certain and secure levels of demand. The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science found that
exporters were about eight per cent more likely to survive from one year to the next compared to non19
exporters with similar firm characteristics.
Exports allow regional Australia to earn flows of income on commodities too plentiful for Australian
industries to consume; yet Australia retains the vast majority of the wealth generated from these
exports.
Further, households benefit directly from trade liberalisation. Removing tariffs reduces prices of
consumer items, improving the standard of living for low and middle-income earners. A study by the
Centre for International Economics has shown that trade liberalisation policies adopted by Australian
governments from 1986 to 2016 have boosted real GDP by 5.4 per cent and increased the average
family household’s real income by $8,448 a year, compared to what they would have been in 2016
20
without trade liberalisation.
Importance of international investment to regional Australia
Trade also encourages investment into Australia, which helps to expand businesses, create new jobs
and introduce new technology and expertise. Giving local businesses access to imported materials,
components, services and other inputs also improves efficiency and keeps prices down.

International investment into Australia is crucial to supplement domestic savings and increases
employment, economic growth, and access to foreign export markets. Foreign direct investment in
Australian mining operations also brings benefits such as transfers of technology, skills and
capabilities, and access to global supply chains and export markets.
Two-way investment flows are particularly important for Australia’s mining industry. The industry has
benefitted from foreign capital in developing Australia’s natural resources and building the mining
industry into the country’s biggest export earner. Many Australian mining companies are also major
global businesses in their own right and pursue outbound investment opportunities around the world,
generating additional benefits for their shareholders and employees, as well as contributing to
development and growth in the countries in which they invest.
The value of international investment in minerals is overwhelmingly retained in Australia. 77 per cent
of the revenue earned by the nation’s major iron ore producers stays in Australia, paid as payments to
21
suppliers or as taxes and royalties to governments.
The value of foreign direct investment in Australia’s resources sector increased eight-fold between
22
2001 and 2016, from $36.8 billion to $310.6 billion. Over the same period, the number of
23
Australians employed in the resources sector grew from around 80,000 in 2001 to 217,000 in 2017.

Benefits of mining operations to regions in Queensland, NSW, WA and NT
Box 2: Glencore – investing locally in low emissions coal and communicating the benefits
Glencore is a global major producer of natural resources including coal, copper, nickel and zinc. The
company is one of Australia’s largest coal producers with 17 operational mines across New South
Wales and Queensland. Glencore’s coal business employs more than 7,000 Australians and in 2016
the company produced nearly 93 million tonnes of thermal and coking coal, predominantly for export.
Glencore acknowledges the need for the world to continue reducing carbon emissions and believes
that government policies globally should support low emission coal technologies – including high
efficiency, low emissions (HELE) generation and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies.
Carbon Transport and Storage Company (CTSCo) Integrated Surat Basin CCS Project
Over the past eight years, Glencore has participated in a number of low emission technology projects
in Australia and overseas. Glencore’s Integrated Surat Basin CCS Project is a demonstration project
located within a single greenhouse gas tenement on Glencore-owned land 15 km from Wandoan. It is
being delivered by CTSCo – a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore.
The Integrated Surat Basin CCS Project aims to demonstrate that CO2 can be safely stored in an
‘industrially scalable’ manner more than 1km underground, at a cost of millions – rather than billions –
of dollars. The project will benefit all emitters of CO2 – be they coal or gas-fired power stations or
industrial producers of cement, iron, steel, fertilizers and chemicals. The geology of the Surat Basin
has up to 2.9 billion tonnes of CO2 storage potential.
The project is currently in feasibility stage undertaking geological studies and environmental baseline
monitoring with a view of gaining permits to inject CO2. A post-combustion-capture plant, attached to
a coal power station, is expected to be built by 2021 and CO2 injection anticipated for 2021 to 2024. It
has received strong industry support from ACALET as well as federal and state governments.
Environmental baseline program
CTSCo is undertaking a comprehensive and multi-year environmental baseline program at the
Glenhaven Project site to understand the presence and concentrations of naturally occurring gases
and chemicals within the project area.
Scientists have installed monitoring sites across the proposed project area, which involves drilling a
number of bores at different depths to collect information using special monitoring equipment. This
equipment sends readings in real time to a central database via mobile phone technology. The
collection of this comprehensive environmental and geological data will enable CTSCo accurately to
monitor the impacts of the sequestration process.
Community and stakeholder engagement
CTSCo is committed to working closely with local communities and fully investigating the economic,
environmental, social and cultural implications of the Integrated Surat Basin CCS Project. The first
stage of the local engagement program involved a community baseline survey. This helped CTSCo
better understand the community and its priorities and potential concerns. The survey’s 60 per cent
response rate highlighted the community’s desire for information about the project and ongoing
dialogue with the company. A number of community leaders (identified through the survey) have
helped inform and design an appropriate engagement approach.
Communicating the science and process behind CCS transport and storage is an important part of
understanding the project in detail. A science-based engagement program is currently being codesigned with Wandoan State School to help build understanding at a grass-roots level. In addition to
this engagement activity will continue at a local community level with one-on-one meetings, group
meetings, community presentations and general public library information sessions.

Policies to promote national and regional growth
The Productivity Commission’s study report on transitioning regional economies makes sensible
policy recommendations for encouraging regional growth and development. The MCA agrees with
the commission that:
•

Industry diversification should not be pursued as an end in itself; regions should instead focus
on producing goods or services that earn them the highest income

•

Government assistance to specific regions or industries should only be granted in the most
exceptional circumstances

•

All regional communities would benefit from removing regulatory obstacles to market
24
opportunities and entrepreneurship.

The Productivity Commission argues persuasively that:
Removing unnecessary regulatory barriers is a ‘win-win’ policy option – these reforms are justifiable in their
own right and also open up opportunities for people in regional communities to adapt to change. They
should be pursued by all governments as a matter of priority. Failure to do so will unnecessarily increase the
25
pressures faced by regional communities and constrain their prospects …

Streamlining environmental regulation
The Productivity Commission’s observation that ‘significant benefits’ would arise from expediting
regulatory reforms in environmental regulation is especially true for the Australian mining
26
industry. A one year delay can reduce the net present value of a major mining project by up to
27
13 per cent and cost up to $1 million every day.
The Productivity Commission has previously argued that overlap and duplication between federal and
28
state processes can be greatly reduced without lowering the quality of environmental outcomes.
State processes should be fully accredited under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity
Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) to create a single assessment and approval process. Assurance
standards will ensure continued federal government oversight and high environmental standards are
29
met.
Analysis by the then Department of the Environment concluded streamlining federal and state
environmental approval processes would save Australian businesses $426 million annually. The
Productivity Commission’s five-year productivity review pointed to a 10 per cent reduction in delay
costs for announced projects and a saving of $240 million if its 2013 recommendations to improve
30
and streamline major project approvals are implemented.
The need to streamline environmental approvals has been recognised by numerous reviews over
many years. The Senate Select Committee on Red Tape found in October 2017 that: ‘delays in
environmental assessment and approval processes are having adverse economic outcomes’ and
recommended that ‘the Australian, state and territory governments recommit to the one-stop shop
31
initiative’. Accordingly, the Australian Parliament should approve the necessary changes to the
EPBC Act and allow environmental approvals to be streamlined.

Modernising workplace relations
The ability to modernise workplaces is vital to the competitiveness of the Australian minerals industry,
32
which is increasingly focused on integrating new technology and ideas into its operations.
Unfortunately, the existing regulatory framework for workplace relations enshrines a number of
rigidities that discourage investment and hinder productivity and innovation (Box 5). If these rigidities
are not addressed, the result will be the retention of outmoded work practices, declining labour
productivity, lower wages and fewer jobs.
Box 5: The undue scope of permitted matters in agreements is hindering workplace efficiency
The Fair Work Act 2009 expanded the range of permitted content in enterprise agreements from
‘matters relating to’ the employment relationship to ‘matters pertaining to’ the employment relationship
– including matters pertaining to employers and trade unions.
Consequently, more content must be bargained over, more issues can form the basis of protected
industrial action, and more content is then able to be included in enterprise agreements which may
then be subject to dispute resolution procedures under those agreements.
In the minerals industry, it is not uncommon to see clauses in enterprise agreements that restrict the
fundamental right of an employer to manage its own business, or which have little to do with the
employer-employee relationship. For example, these clauses can require employers to:
•

Consult with unions on changes to regular rosters or ordinary hours of work

•

Restrict retrenchment to a ‘last-in, first-out’ policy

•

Restrict or prohibit the use of contractors or labour hire workers

•

Provide employee representatives with the names and commencement dates of new
employees

•

Provide paid leave for employees to attend to union business.

The MCA supports removing the availability of protected industrial action for matters not directly
related to the employment relationship. This would improve workplace efficiency by ensuring that:
•

Negotiations are not stifled by claims that constrain an employer’s ability to manage the
workforce and work flow

•

The bargaining process has a clear employment focus and protected industrial action cannot
33
be misused for ulterior purposes.

The Productivity Commission proposed a suite of detailed reforms in 2015, which it has since
34
estimated would add $850 million a year to the Australian economy. The MCA broadly supports the
Productivity Commission’s workplace relations reform agenda and recommends five urgent priorities,
which are summarised in the policy checklist below.
Liberalising coastal shipping
The liberalisation of coastal shipping is another striking example of overdue microeconomic
reform. The current regulatory regime is burdensome, anti-competitive and failing to achieve its
own objective of revitalising the local shipping industry. The Productivity Commission estimated
in October 2017 that removing restrictions on coastal shipping would boost the Australian

economy by between $19 million and $36 million a year. While the Coastal Trading
(Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017 proposes a number of improvements to
the operation and administration of the Coastal Trading Act, they do not go far enough.
Achieving minimum effective regulation
Regulatory settings have a profound impact on the mining industry’s cost competitiveness,
productivity and capacity to adapt to changing market conditions. Regulatory requirements cover all
stages of industry activity, from grant of tenure, exploration, extraction, processing, transport and
mine closure through to relinquishment of tenure. Minimising the regulatory burden on industry is not
the same as minimising regulation itself. The Australia’s mining industry recognises its obligation to
act in a way that assists government in maintaining efficient, stable and risk-based regulatory
frameworks.
The essential challenge is to ensure regulation not only is directed at legitimate objectives, but that it
takes an appropriate form. The Australian mining industry supports the principle of ‘minimum
effective regulation’, whereby regulation can both meet its policy objectives and do so at least cost.
The Abbott Government implemented an annual red tape reduction target and biannual repeal days.
The Turnbull Government has replaced these measures with the National Business Simplification
Initiative, which aims to improve existing regulation and business transactions with government. A
recommitment to a comprehensive deregulation agenda would help to bring about a change in the
culture of regulation; to move from periodic reviews and incremental reforms to a permanent program
of reduction and improvement.
Making Australia’s tax system more conducive to investment and jobs
A competitive tax system is critical for investment in capital-intensive industries such as mining.
Mining projects involve high-risk exploration outlays, large upfront capital commitments, long-life
assets, sophisticated technologies and long lead times to profitability. Competition from other
resource-rich economies to capture future opportunities in resource development is intense.
The combination of state and territory royalties with federal company tax means Australia is a
relatively high tax jurisdiction for mining. The Australian minerals industry paid $185 billion in
company tax and royalties in the 11 years to 2015-16. The Australian minerals industry has an
effective tax rate of 51 per cent. Deloitte and state budget papers show royalty payments to the
states are almost triple what they were a decade ago, increasing from $4 billion in 2007-08 to over
36
$11 billion in 2016-17.
At the same time, the Productivity Commission has confirmed in successive reports that
Australian mining receives ‘negligible’ assistance from government. The commission found that
the effective rate of combined assistance for the mining industry (i.e., the ratio of assistance to output)
is just 0.2 per cent. While the Productivity Commission attributed $521 million in budgetary
assistance to mining in 2016-17, most of this amount ($402 million) consisted of offsets claimed under
37
the R&D tax incentive – a measure applicable to all industries.
Australia’s 30 per cent company tax rate is simply too high for a capital-hungry country. The MCA
commissioned a policy paper on the implications of tax reform in the United States for Australia’s
investment attractiveness. Australia’s investment challenge in wake of 2018 US tax reform, by the
University of Calgary’s Dr Jack Mintz and Mr Philip Bazel, argued that:
•

By 2020 Australia is set to have the second highest company tax rate in the Organisation of
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

•

Australia’s marginal effective tax rate is now 28.4 per cent, almost ten percentage points
higher than in the United States

•

Tax reform by the United States has an enormous effect on international business decisions
and the tax policies of competitor countries

•

Australia taxes mining more heavily than comparable countries do

•

Lower company taxes raise the standard of living of residents, both through higher wages and
38
lower prices for consumer goods.

Australian businesses need a lower corporate tax rate to increase investment, jobs and wages. The
Government’s Enterprise Tax Plan legislation to reduce the corporate tax rate for all companies will
39
move Australia’s corporate tax rate back towards the current OECD average of 24 per cent.
The
last corporate rate reduction to 30 per cent in 2001, with bipartisan support, moved Australia closer to
the then OECD average (31 per cent).
Fuel Tax Credits
Fuel Tax Credits (FTCs) are critical to a diverse range of regional industries reliant on diesel, including
mining, agriculture and tourism. FTCs ensure that fuel excise, as an effective road user charge, is
not applied to off-road use of diesel and other fuels. Any reduction to FTCs would have a significant,
negative and disproportionate impact on regional Australia. It would be a new tax on regional
industries and have no basis in sensible tax policy.
Box 6: Fuel Tax Credits are vital to the competitiveness and growth of regional Australia
Stable tax arrangements for business inputs such as fuel are vital to industry competitiveness and
investor confidence. Long distances and remoteness of operations mean that existing arrangements
for FTCs are particularly important for mining.
A number of farming and mining operations, fishing and tourism operators have no access to on-grid
electricity, with a large share of these populations in regional Australia (Appendix). For many remote
communities and businesses, diesel is the only option for reliable power generation.
Mining operations in regional Australia are heavily reliant on diesel fuel as an input – where miners
build and operate their own roads and operate off the electricity grid in remote regions. Diesel fuel is
among the top three expenses for many open cut mines and consumption accounts for up to onequarter of operating costs at some mines.
FTCs offset the excise imposed on fuel used by businesses. FTCs are based on the same tax
principle underpinning the goods and services tax, which is to avoid taxes on business inputs. The
claim that FTCs represent a ‘subsidy’ to industry is wrong and has been categorically refuted by the
40
Australian Treasury, leading economists and the Productivity Commission.
Any move to abolish the FTC scheme would harm regional Australian communities reliant on diesel.
It would be grossly inequitable and set back economic development in regional Australia.

Ensuring reliable and affordable energy that lowers emissions
Reliable and affordable energy is central to the competitiveness of the national economy and the
standard of living of Australians. Policy measures must deliver reliable and affordable energy at least
cost while putting Australia on a pathway to meeting its emissions reduction targets.
The MCA regards the National Energy Guarantee High Level Design Document as a step forward in
addressing the long-running energy policy challenge confronting Australia. The Paper addressed a
number of concerns the MCA has identified as challenges that the National Energy Guarantee must
meet – these challenges included:
•

Delivering reliable and affordable energy at least cost while putting Australia on a pathway to
meeting its emissions reduction targets.

•

Driving investment in lowest cost dispatchable energy that is available 24/7.

•

Confirming that the Australian Energy Market Operator’s forecasts are accurate and reliable.

•

Detailing how the reliability and emissions guarantee contracts will work in practice. Of
particular concern is whether the National Energy Guarantee will lead to a greater
concentration of market power.

•

Ensuring that the emissions guarantee takes a least-cost approach to abatement, including
access to international and domestic offsets.

•

Consulting fully and publicly when developing the proposed complementary measures,
41
namely demand response, strategic reserve and day-ahead markets.

Recommendations
Project approvals and environnmental regulation
•

Streamlining state and federal approval processes while maintaining environmental
protection.

•

Preventing vexatious legal challenges to approved projects.

•

Removing the duplicative water trigger for coal seam gas and large coal developments.

•

Removing uranium mining, milling, decommissioning and rehabilitation from the nuclear
trigger in the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

•

Improving the efficiency of environmental assessment and approvals processes by:
-

Setting information requirements to manage clearly defined risks

-

Increased use of alternative assessment mechanisms

-

Coordinating environmental offset requirements between federal and state
governments.

•

Confining permitted content in enterprise agreements to direct employment matters.

•

Refocusing adverse action provisions to discourage unreasonable claims.

•

Rebalancing union right-of-entry provisions to prevent unwarranted disruptions to operations.

•

Reforming greenfields agreements to encourage investment in new projects.

•

Allowing high-income earners to enter into individual agreements.

Taxation
•

Reducing Australia’s internationally uncompetitive corporate tax rate.

•

Maintaining the Fuel Tax Credit scheme and the immediate deductibility of exploration
expenditure

•

Preserving the research and development (R&D) tax incentive in its current form and not
restricting eligibility on the basis of industry, firm size, R&D intensity or any other arbitrary
criterion.

Energy and climate change
•

Ensuring that energy and climate change policies:
-

Are nationally coordinated and recognise the energy and resources-intensive nature of
the Australian economy

-

Allow least-cost CO2 emissions abatement, including through access to international
offsets

-

Embody a technology-neutral approach that does not discriminate against nuclear power,
high-efficiency, low-emission coal generation, or carbon capture and storage

-

Reduce energy costs in Australia by securing an energy supply that is reliable, low cost,
dispatchable, available 24/7, and consistent with Australia’s emissions reduction targets.

Free trade and open investment
•

Maintaining an open economy by supporting free trade and attracting international
investment. This includes supporting Australia joining the Comprehensive and Progressive
Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP-11), which will open new markets for
Australia’s regional industries, including mining and energy resources, as well as
manufacturing and agriculture.

Deregulation and competition policy
•

Pursuing a comprehensive deregulation agenda that:
-

Considers non-regulation options for achieving policy objectives

-

Ensures any new regulations are efficient, in that they:

•



Proceed from an established case for regulatory action



Enshrine the best (or least worst) of available options



Set unambiguous objectives that do not overlap



Manage risks proportionately rather than prescriptively

Minimises the existing stock of regulation.

Liberalising coastal shipping by:
-

Introducing a single permit system allowing unrestricted trade for both domestic and
foreign vessels

-

Ensuring that Australian and foreign-registered vessels are subject to the same
conditions of access and operation by removing the ability of domestic ships to contest
voyages proposed by foreign ships.

2. REGIONAL BENEFITS OF LABOUR MOBILITY AND SKILLED MIGRATION
•

Labour mobility is essential to existing operations and new projects in the mining industry.
Strategies such as fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) and drive-in, drive-out (DIDO) arrangements, together
with an effective skilled migration program, help sustain mining activity in regional areas. The
Productivity Commission observes that labour mobility spreads the income and employment
benefits of mining well beyond where resource extraction occurs.

•

The Productivity Commission notes that regulatory impediments (such as occupational
licensing requirements that differ across jurisdictions) reduce labour mobility, making it
difficult for people in regional communities to pursue employment or training opportunities.
The MCA recommends simplifying the mutual recognition process under the Mutual
Recognition Act 1992, so people holding a licence in one jurisdiction are entitled to a licence
in all jurisdictions, rather than being required to obtain a separate license for each jurisdiction.

•

The minerals industry employs less than one per cent of its workforce through temporary
skilled migration (1,710 in September 2017) and more than 90 per cent of these are
professionals, managers and technical trades. The MCA will continue to work with its
members and the Australian Government to monitor the impact of the new temporary skilled
visa system and ensure further changes are considered as economic circumstances change.

In its Transitioning Regional Economies report, the Productivity Commission concluded that the
mining boom – despite some transitional pressures – has made regions in Australia ‘substantially
42
better off in the short term and over the long term’. The commission found that Australia’s ‘regions
have enjoyed overall employment growth and improved social connections’, particularly through
improved technology. In particular, most regions in Australia (77 per cent) had experienced positive
43
growth in employment over the past five years – and continue to grow strongly.
Highly skilled, highly paid jobs in regional and remote Australia
Mining in Australia is a sophisticated and technologically advanced enterprise that demands a
highly skilled and adaptable workforce. As identified in Table 1 below, resource companies employ
more than 217,000 people in high-wage, high-skilled jobs, predominantly in remote and regional
44
Australia.

Average earnings in the resources sector are around $140,000 a year, more than 60 per cent
45
higher than the average for all industries.
Australia’s resources workforce covers a range of scientific fields and professional occupations. The
resources sector is Australia’s largest total employer of:
•

Mining engineers (10,070)

•

Geologists and geophysicists (7,160)

•

Industrial and mechanical engineers (10,200)

•

Metallurgists and physicists (1,640).

Nationally, mining is also the third-biggest employer of environmental scientists, employing more than
47
9,950 directly and indirectly.
Importance of labour mobility to economic efficiency and employee choice
As part of its commitment to communities, the minerals industry prioritises local employment and
sourcing. In many cases, companies have established local training programs and provide relocation
support for employees to support this priority.
However, the remote location of Australian mining operations makes fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) and drive-in,
drive-out (DIDO) arrangements a necessity for many operators and their employees, especially for
highly specialist professional, technical and trade roles.
The Productivity Commission has pointed out that labour mobility improves the overall resilience of
48
49
the economy. Further, labour mobility spreads the benefits of the mining boom into other regions.
The commission also found that FIFO arrangements softened the impact of the end of the investment
50
boom in a number of regions.
In its final report, the Productivity Commission points to positive impacts of labour mobility:
While the mining boom has caused transitional pressures, it has also made Australians substantially better
off in the short term and over the long term. A mobile workforce (including fly-in, fly-out) has spread the
benefits of the boom across workers living in other regions, as well as reduced the cost of both the
investment phase and the ongoing production phase. Adjustment from the mining boom is generally not a
51
source of significant disadvantage and does not justify special intervention from governments ..
During the height of the resources boom (in 2011), an estimated 50 000 people worked under fly-in, fly-out
(FIFO) arrangements in the Pilbara. FIFO workers in the resources sector included those also working in
construction (during the investment phase) and delivering other services to mining communities (for
52
example, chefs, cleaners, personal trainers, and health professionals).

The Productivity Commission noted that the mining boom was ‘particularly transformative’ the Pilbara
region. Many people moved to the region to take advantage of employment opportunities, and
income growth in the region was well above the national average (8.4 per cent per year during the
53
investment boom). The commission found that the benefits of the boom spread beyond the regions
54
where mining activity was occurring – including in Perth and the southwestern Western Australia.
The high disposable incomes of many employees – coupled with the flexibility of a FIFO roster –

brought the benefits back to local regions and Perth in particular. Some towns – such as Leinster and
55
Goldsworthy – were developed solely to service the mining industry in the Kimberley region.
Far from restricting opportunities, labour mobility in the mining industry has boosted incomes,
56
attracted families and reduced unemployment in mining regions. Research conducted in February
2017 by academics at James Cook University confirms that availability of rental accommodation,
quality service provision – measured by the number of students per teacher and the number of people
per medical practitioner – encourages workers to move to a region and discourages long distance
57
commuting.
The Productivity Commission argues that regulatory impediments that reduce labour mobility make it
more difficult for people in regional communities to pursue employment or training opportunities.
These include occupational licensing requirements, particularly where there are different
58
arrangements across jurisdictions. Removing or reducing the impact of such barriers is crucial to
59
enabling people and businesses in regions to make better use of their existing resources.
Misconceptions about labour mobility have diverted attention away from important matters, such as
mental health. The Western Australian Parliamentary Inquiry into mental health impacts of FIFO work
60
arrangements was not able to substantiate a causal link between FIFO and suicide. The
Queensland Parliamentary Inquiry into fly-in, fly-out and other long distance commuting practices in
regional Queensland concluded that the benefits of resource activity such as employment must be
available to all and that workers should be able to make their own informed decision about where they
61
live for work.
As part of its commitment to the health and safety of its workforce, the minerals industry has
developed a range of resources to assist employers and employees and their families in their
considered and informed FIFO or DIDO employment choice. See, for example: MCA Blueprint for
Mental Health and Wellbeing, www.thisfifolife.com, www.fifofacts.com.au, and
https://www.ruok.org.au/every-day-resources.
Benefits of skilled migration
The minerals industry employs approximately one per cent of its workforce through temporary skilled
62
migration, accounting for two per cent of temporary skilled workers. More than 90 percent of these
63
are professionals, managers and technical trades. An effective temporary skilled migration program
is a vital component of meeting the skills and needs of the sector.
In considering the economic, social and environmental impact of migration, the Productivity
Commission has reported that overall immigration is likely to deliver net benefits to the Australian
64
community. In particular, the commission noted that:
[O]ver the long term, selecting migrants with higher rates of workforce engagement and employment in
65
skilled and high demand occupations is likely to deliver improved economic outcomes.

Nonetheless, the industry remains concerned with some aspects of the changes to the temporary
skilled migration scheme announced on 18 April 2017 (with revisions on 1 July 2017) that came into
effect in March 2018. These concerns include:

•

The arbitrary upper age limit of 45 years (or 50 years in some cases) prevents knowledge
experts, senior managers and leaders (including chief executives) from taking up key
positions to aid Australia’s competitive advantage in the sector

•

Lack of certainty for both visa sponsors and approved temporary skilled visa holders of their
longer term prospects when the associated occupations move on, off, between and/or off both
the Medium and Long-term Strategic Skills List (MLTSSL) and the Short-term Skilled
Occupations List (STSOL)

•

It is unclear how the Skilling Australia Fund, to be wholly funded from a levy, will be allocated.
The MCA suggests funds be allocated proportionally to each industry’s use of the temporary
skilled migration visas to support skilling and upskilling for that and ancillary industries.

Recommendations
•

Noting the Productivity Commission’s finding that fly-in, fly-out and drive-in, drive-out
arrangements have been instrumental in alleviating skill shortages and spreading the benefits
of the mining boom, the MCA does not support any further changes to existing labour mobility
regulations and programs.

•

The MCA concurs with the Productivity Commission that streamlining occupational licensing
rules across jurisdictions would improve labour mobility. The MCA recommends simplifying
the mutual recognition process under the Mutual Recognition Act 1992, so people holding a
licence in one jurisdiction are entitled to a licence in all jurisdictions, rather than being
required to obtain a separate license for each jurisdiction.

•

The MCA broadly supports the findings of the Productivity Commission's Migrant Intake into
Australia report. The MCA in particular agrees that policy changes that affect skilled
migration should be informed by evidence based and consider the appropriate mix and
influence of economic, social and environmental factors. Accordingly, the MCA considers that
some of the conditions of the Temporary Skill Shortage visa (compared to the 457 visa) will
restrict the mining industry’s access to skilled employees and hinder its competitiveness.

3. CONTRIBUTION OF MINING AND METS TO REGIONS IN VICTORIA
•

Deloitte Access Economics has estimated that the total economic contribution to Victoria of
the mining and mining equipment, technology and services (METS) sector was $13.6 billion
in 2015-16. The corresponding total employment contribution was 121,700 full-time jobs.

•

Lignite-fired electricity generation is integral to the competitiveness of Victorian manufacturers
– including in regional Victoria – and the affordability and reliability of the National Australian
Electricity Market. In finalising the design of the National Energy Guarantee, the Energy
Security Board needs to ensure sufficient levels of lowest cost, dispatchable energy supplies
available 24/7.

•

The state government should improve environmental approval processes and land use
planning to make Victoria a more attractive destination for minerals investment. It should also
remove restrictions on the development of Victoria's resources, including lignite but also
conventional and unconventional gas.

A significant economic contribution to regional Victoria
Deloitte Access Economics estimates that in 2015-16, Victoria’s mining and METS sector contributed
$8.6 billion in direct value added to the state’s economy, supporting 88,000 full-time jobs particularly
in the Murray and Gippsland basins and around Ballarat and Bendigo. Deloitte also estimated a $5.4
66
billion indirect contribution, supporting a further 33,700 full-time jobs.
Together, the overall direct and indirect contribution of the mining and METS sector to Victoria in
2015-16 was $13.6 billion, representing 4 per cent of economic activity in the state. In addition to
Melbourne-based mining services, a significant driver of this contribution is regionally based mining
and METS operations.
Mining activity generated an estimated $81 million in royalties for Victoria in 2016-17. Over the four
67
years to 2020-21, mining royalties are forecast to total $373 million. The vast majority of mining
royalties in Victoria are generated from lignite (brown coal) production for energy generation. The
mining of lignite (brown coal) in the Latrobe Valley generated $66.4 million in state royalties in 201668
17 and is expected to yield approximately $300 million over the four years to 2020-21.
While the contribution of lignite royalties to state revenue significant, the tripling of the royalty rate –
from 7.6 cents to 22.8 cents per gigajoule of energy from 1 January 2017 – has contributed to the
recent significant increase in electricity prices. In its 2016-17 Budget, the Victorian government
forecasted this would deliver $252 million of additional revenue between 2016-17 and 2019-20. The
increase was justified on the spurious basis of aligning the royalty rate for lignite (which is only used
for domestic energy generation) with the royalty regimes for the black coal industries of Queensland
and New South Wales (which export around 90 per cent of their output).
Regional benefits of mining and METS
Victoria’s mining industry includes lignite operations in the Latrobe Valley, gold production in central
Victoria and a pipeline of world-class minerals sands projects in the Murray and Gippsland Basins.
Australia’s only antimony mine is also located near Bendigo (Box 7).
Existing operations contribute directly to local communities through employment and business
opportunities, as well as through support for community initiatives and projects. Deloitte Access

Economics confirms that Victoria is a ‘national hub for METS exports, with strong manufacturing and
engineering capabilities operating in regional hubs such as Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo’ as well as
69
metropolitan Melbourne. The spread of manufacturing and engineering capability across regional
Victoria is another important means by which the benefits of mining are shared supporting the
livelihoods and strong wages for mining and METS employees and economic growth.
Box 7: Contribution of gold and antimony mining to Bendigo and Heathcote communities
Fosterville Mine
The Fosterville Gold Mine is an underground mine situated 20 kilometres from Bendigo. Owned by
Kirkland Lake Gold, it has a strong community engagement investment program including outreach
sessions to discuss future exploration projects at the mine and an annual open day, which in 2016
attracted more than 500 visitors.
As part of this approach, Fosterville Gold Mine runs a community grants program that helps
community groups undertake a wide range of activities. The round is conducted twice a year. The
mine has assisted 183 community groups and allocated over $266,000 through the grants program.
In April 2018, Fosterville Gold Mine announced six successful community grants, with recipients
including the Bendigo Kart Club, Eppalock Primary School, Bendigo Community Toy Library, Bendigo
V.R.I. Bowling Club, Axedale CFA, Rushworth Kindergarten and the Friends of the Bendigo-Kilmore
Rail Trail.
Costerfield gold and antimony mine
Mandalay Resources’ Costerfield gold-antimony mine is situated in central Victoria, around 10
kilometres south of Heathcote in Victoria. Mandalay undertook community surveys in three locations
in 2016. Based on the responses, Costerfield scored highly with 51 per cent of respondents saying
they highly valued the mine’s presence in their communities and 35 per cent said they moderately
valued it.
Healthcote Childcare Centre
Access to childcare for pre-school and primary school children has long been a priority for the growing
community of Heathcote, Victoria. Understanding its importance to the local community, Mandalay
Resources engaged the Community Child Care Association to develop a prefeasibility study for a new
childcare service in the town during 2015.
With strong support from the community, Mandalay Resources funded the appointment of a project
manager in 2017 to progress the study. After investigating a range of options, a hybrid children’s
community hub, including a managed long day care model, was proposed.
In December 2017 the Victorian Government announced it would fund development of the hub with
the local St John’s Parish donating the land and additional funds. This resulted from an initial
investment by Mandalay Resources of approximately $100,000 in various feasibility studies and
appointment of a project manager.
Construction of the hub, which will transform early childhood education and employment options for
Heathcote residents, commenced in April 2018 and will be completed in late 2018.
An untapped opportunity for new regional jobs and investment
With its skilled labour force and growing global demand for minerals, Victoria has the potential to
transform its minerals endowment prospectivity into a new pipeline of new investment and jobs in
regional Victoria.

This endowment includes 42.8 per cent and 34.5 per cent of Australia’s economically demonstrated
70
resources of rutile and zircon (mineral sands) respectively. Geological Survey Victoria studies also
indicate potential for discovery of new multi-million ounce gold deposits. New research also indicates
71
the potential for copper discoveries.
A new minerals investment pipeline is much-needed in regional Victoria, which has been
disproportionately affected by structural changes underway across the state’s economy. While
regional Victoria achieved its highest rate of economic growth since 1999-2000 in 2016-17, this
follows almost a decade of stagnation. A new minerals investment pipeline would support the
72
creation of high skill, high wage jobs and assist to diversify economies across regional Victoria.
There is strong recognition of the potential for developing minerals resources in regional Victoria. The
Productivity Commission has cited the Victorian government-commissioned 2015 Regional Economic
Development and Services Review, which identified development of the state’s earth resources
73
(particularly mineral sands) as an opportunity to ‘drive inclusive growth and create regional jobs.’
Box 8: Kalbar Fingerboards Mineral Sands: Employment opportunities for Gippsland
Located near Glenaladale on the Wellington and East Gippsland Shire Board, the Kalbar
Fingerboards Minerals Sands is based on one of the largest and highest grade mineral sands
deposits in the world. The minerals are in high demand from renewable energy, electric vehicles,
ceramics, pigments and high-tech consumer goods. When operational, the project will be Victoria’s
fifth mineral sands mine.
Over an initial mine life of 20 years, the mine will provide direct jobs for 200 people in addition to a
further 200 across the region. This is a significant opportunity for the Gippsland region, which has
recently been affected by the closure of a number of significant employers in the energy and timber
sectors.
Box 9: Donald Mineral Sands: New development for the Murray Basin
Donald Mineral Sands, located 66 kilometres northeast of Horsham in Victoria’s Murray Basin, is a
titanium and zircon mineral sand development project.
Over recent years, over $60 million has been invested to support development of Donald Mineral
Sands with work underway to optimise the mine plan and obtain other final approvals. The current
estimated cost suggests the project could be one of the most significant private investment projects in
regional Victoria. Once operational, the project could provide 200 direct jobs over a mine life of (at
least) 25 years.
Encouraging a new wave of minerals investment in Victoria

exploration investment peaked at more than $4 billion. Exploration expenditure in Victoria totalled
76
$40.7 million in 2016-17 and accounted for 2.6 per cent of Australia’s total exploration expenditure.
A number of government reports have recommended substantial reforms to reposition Victoria’s
attractiveness as a destination for new minerals investment. This includes the Regional Economic
Development and Services Review, which concluded that:
The existing legislative arrangements for earth resources projects have evolved through the accumulation of
assessment and approvals processes over the last 30 years. A transformational regulatory reform package
is required to make Victoria competitive in a global market for earth resources projects, particularly to
overcome the lengthy, costly and uncertain process to obtain environmental and planning approvals, while
77
maintaining safeguards to protect public health, other land uses and the environment.

These conclusions align with findings from the Victorian Parliament’s Economic Development and
Infrastructure Committee’s 2012 Inquiry into greenfields exploration and project development in
Victoria. In addition to perceptions that Victoria was ‘closed’ to new minerals investment, the
committee noted misperceptions of conflict between the minerals and agricultural industries. Both
industries have co-existed in Victoria for more than 160 years and active and inactive mining licences
78
account for just 0.2 per cent of Victoria’s total land area. Unlocking Victoria’s potential minerals
investment pipeline requires coordination and urgent action by the state and local governments.
Priority areas for policy action and regulatory reform
•

Designating the minerals industry as a priority sector for attracting investment and facilitating
projects

•

Reducing unnecessary delays in project approvals by improving the efficiency of development
processes and enhancing coordination between agencies

•

Assisting councils in strategic land-use planning, building on the Council of Australian
Governments (COAG) Multi-Land Use Planning Framework

•

Removing restrictions on the development of Victoria's resources, including lignite but also
conventional and unconventional gas.

Energy security and regional development: the opportunity for the Latrobe Valley
The National Institute of Economic and Industry Research forecasted that the closure of Hazelwood
power station in March 2017 would result in a loss of 2,000 local jobs and a $340 million reduction of
79
the gross regional product in the Latrobe Valley – one of Victoria’s most disadvantaged regions.
Removal of a source of secure, baseload power also has broader consequences for energy-intensive
industries in the Gippsland region – where manufacturing businesses that export internationally are
80
losing their cost competitive advantage in cheap energy. For example, Grant Crothers CEO of
Burra Food a South Gippsland based dairy processing business that exports to Asia in his March
2017 blog wrote:
[T]he last six months has been brutal where we have seen a 90 per cent increase in electricity costs and an

80 per cent increase in the cost of natural gas … an additional expenditure on energy of millions of dollars.

4. CONTRIBUTION OF MINING TO NORTHERN TERRITORY
•

Deloitte Access Economics estimated that the direct and indirect economic contributions of
the mining and the mining equipment, technology and services (METS) sector to the Northern
Territory economy were $3.2 billion in 2015-16, representing 10 per cent of economic activity.
In the same financial year, the sector employed a 23,459 people (directly and indirectly).

•

The mining industry is the second largest sector in the Territory and will continue to be a key
driver of economic growth and development in northern Australia. Currently more than a
dozen new and proposed mining projects are in the pipeline.

•

To realise the significant benefits of mining and related activities, the Territory Government
should avoid discouraging investment by imposing a new ad valorem royalty regime on top of
the existing profits-based system. The government should also broaden strategic land-use
approaches, make the security bond system more modern and workable, facilitate new export
infrastructure, and collaborate with industry to raise public awareness of the contribution of
mining to the Territory.

Promoting and realising broad community benefits from mining
Sound governance that promotes investment ensures the mining industry can continue to deliver a
broad range of benefits to the Northern Territory. The Territory’s minerals sector is a major source of
export income, economic growth and employment, with significant untapped potential for further
growth and expansion. Development of the sector will play a vital role in building and sustainable
regional communities, population growth, income growth and improved standards of living.
Significant contribution of mining and METS to the Northern Territory economy
The mining and METS sector represents an important source of economic activity in the Northern
Territory. Deloitte Access Economics estimates the mining and METS sector (excluding oil and gas)
contributed a total of $3.2 billion in value added to the Northern Territory’s economy in 2015-16. The
sector supported around 23,500 full-time-equivalent jobs – 13,500 directly employed, 10,000
84
85
indirectly. $1.2 billion was paid in wages and salaries in the NT resources sector in 2015-16.
The value of key commodities produced in the Northern Territory in 2015-16 were:
•

Gold ($885 million)

•

Manganese ($829 million)

•

Zinc and lead concentrate ($504 million)

•

Bauxite ($448 million)

•

Uranium ($314 million)

•

Other minerals ($69.7 million)

86

Over the past decade, mineral commodities have ranged between 15-35 per cent of total goods
87
exported from the Northern Territory. Mineral production this financial year is expected to
strengthen as new mineral operations commence. The completion of expansion works at the
Newmont Tanami gold mine is expected to drive this increase. With the OM Manganese operated

Bootu Creek manganese mine re-opening in early 2017, manganese is expected to contribute
significantly to the economy of the Northern Territory. As at August 2017, 200,000 tonnes of ore had
88
already been exported and 180 employees had been re-employed at the mine site. In the past year,
the Northern Territory government has awarded major project status to several new mineral resources
projects, including the Jervois copper-silver-gold project; the Mount Peake vanadium-titanium project;
the Verdant Minerals Ammaroo Phosphate project; and Arafura Resources Nolans rare earths and
phosphate project in the Alice Springs region.
Significant contribution of mining to the Northern Territory’s regional, remote and Aboriginal
communities
The mining and energy sectors have the potential to contribute significant benefits to regional and
Indigenous Territorians, through the creation of highly skilled and well-paid jobs (recall Chart 1
above). Mining employment is critically important to many regional and remote communities in
Australia, with 61 per cent of industry employment in regional and remote areas, compared with 37
per cent for all industries. Mining accounts for up to 50 per cent of employment in some regional
89
centres.
Mining-related employment is much more significant to the Northern Territory labour market than to
Australia as a whole, with 3.2 per cent of the labour force directly employed in the Territory’s
90
resources sector.
The mining, energy and related mining related services industry is the second highest employer of
Indigenous Australians, with approximately 5,509 Indigenous Australians employed, up from an
91
average of less than one per cent 20 years ago.
At some mining sites, Indigenous workers account for up to 40 per cent of those directly and indirectly
employed. MCA member companies have developed a range of strategies aimed at retention and
career development for Indigenous employees. These include mentoring, flexible work
arrangements, workplace literacy and numeracy training. Many mining companies also support
students from local communities through work experience and school-based apprenticeships (see
Boxes 10, 11 and 12 below).
The minerals industry is the largest private employer of Indigenous Australians, with an overall rate of
16 per cent across the Territory, with some companies and some skilled occupations (e.g., haul truck
92
drivers) exceeding 20 per cent.
The June 2017 Northern Territory Economic Development Framework identified mineral production
and exploration as the main drivers of economic activity and employment in central Australia (Alice
93
Springs region), the East Arnhem region and Katherine region – in the short to medium term.

nearby Gulkula, which is the site of the annual Garma Festival. The mine aims to produce 15,000
95
metric tons of bauxite in its first year.
Rio Tinto has assisted the venture by providing $2.4 million towards the establishment of the Yolngu
training centre. The centre will provide training for Yolngu people to prepare for bauxite mining
96
operations. The training centre aims to produce 15 Indigenous graduates who would be able to
97
work in the mine when it commences operations. The first batch of 20 trainees will commence a 17week residential course of study at the facility in August 2017. In addition to job specific training,
participants will receive training on workplace health and safety and negotiation skills, with the aim of
ensuring the graduates will be able to actively participate in the mining industry rather than just being
98
spectators.

Box 12: Newmont Tanami Operations
Newmont is a global mining company that has approximately 30,000 employees throughout the world.
It has owned and operated the Tanami mine in the remote Tanami Dessert of Northern Australia since
2002. The mine and plant are located on Aboriginal freehold land that is owned by the Warlpiri
99
people and managed by the Central Desert Aboriginal Trust. The site is the most remote in
Australia, with the closest communities of Yuendumu and Lajamanu approximately 257 km south and
100
327 km north east of the mine.
Newmont’s Tanami operations have contributed nearly $374 million to the economy through
procurement, payroll taxes, government royalties, land use payments and community projects. It
101
directly employed over 100 Aboriginal workers in 2017, approximately 13 per cent of its workforce.
Community
Newmont has a dedicated community relations team on site at its Tanami Operations to encourage
dialogue with all stakeholders. Newmont invests in community programs including support for the
Warlpiri Youth Development Aboriginal Corporation; Learning Centre and community school
workshops (including training, equipment and book supplies); Charles Darwin University scholarships,
development of Violent Behaviour and Aggressive Risk Assessment Protocols; Warlpiri Education
and Training Trust; and contributes to a large number of projects funded through the Granites Mine
Affected Areas Aboriginal Corporation , that works to improve literacy among young children in the
102
community. In 2016 Newmont, the Central Land Council (CLC) and Yapa developed a guide for
working together to achieve stronger outcomes for Yapa. This plan (Granites-Kurra Ten Year Plan)
was reviewed and endorsed by traditional owners and CLC regional delegates in June 2017. The
plan highlights the outcomes that the CLC, Newmont and Yapa can achieve to strengthen Yapa
103
voice, employment and education in the Tanami region.
Cultural events
Newmont continues to invest in aboriginal art with examples of sponsorships of the Land Rights Anniversary Arts Award Catalogue (2016) and the display and selling of Aboriginal art to employees
at and visitors to at the operations.
Newmont is the major corporate sponsor of the Milpirri Festival, a cultural dance held every two
years that brings together male and female elders, parents, and young people to express their
culture through traditional and contemporary forms of dance. The Festival is credited with
increasing school attendance throughout the year and connecting generations by sharing cultural
104
customs and stories in a modern setting.

Priority areas for policy action and regulatory reform
Not proceeding with hybrid royalty scheme that will jeopardise additional mining investment
In April 2018, the Northern Territory Government announced the introduction of a hybrid royalty
scheme. From 1 July 2019, the new scheme requires mining companies to pay the greater of the
existing 20 per cent profits-based scheme, or a value-based royalty on their gross mineral production
revenue at a rate of:
•

1.0 per cent in a mine’s first mineral royalty year on or after 1 July 2019

•

2.0 per cent in the second mineral royalty year

•

2.5 per cent in the third and following mineral royalty years.

105

The government’s announced chance to the Territory’s royalty regime adds further complexity and
risk to the investment attractiveness of the NT resources sector. The sector will contribute
approximately $350 million of royalties in 2017-18 with scope to contribute more in future should new
projects move into construction and operation.
The hybrid royalty scheme will generate little additional revenue according to budget estimates, but
creates further doubt around the investment regime putting future investment and jobs at risk.
Government policy should be focused on facilitating the resources projects on the cusp of final
investment decision to get to market as soon as possible, not imposing an additional and punitive
royalty obligation.
Maximising productivity and improving environmental regulation
Streamlining environmental assessment and approval processes to remove duplication, delays and
complexity can be done without compromising the effectiveness of environmental regulation.
Achieving this would increase business certainty and encourage further investment in the sector.
Competition for markets, investment and talented people is intense in a world where mineral
resources are widely available (recall section 1 above).
Better alignment between Territory and federal approval processes would provide regulatory certainty
and reduce approval timeframes. The Productivity Commission concluded in 2013 that overlap and
duplication can be reduced without diminishing environmental outcomes.
The Northern Territory’s environmental regulatory processes should be accredited under the
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to create a single assessment and
approval process to ensure high environmental standards with risk-based monitoring and reporting
arrangements.
The Northern Territory Government should encourage the federal parliament to approve changes to
the EPBC Act to allow these reforms. Post-approval regulation also needs to be more cost-effective,
with monitoring and reporting requirements reflecting risk and consistent with industry best practice.
Maximising benefits through resource management reforms and modernising security bonds
Resource management reforms and multiple land-use should be encouraged and supported to
maximise the benefits of mining and other land uses for all Territorians.
Water availability and security of supply are critical business risks for a range of industries including
the minerals sector. Mine operators frequently supply, operate and maintain their own water
infrastructure and provide a reliable water supply to other stakeholders including neighbouring remote
and indigenous communities, farmers and pastoralists. Water planning and access arrangements
should account for the specific needs and characteristics of all water users, including the minerals
industry.

The mining industry undertakes extensive biodiversity assessments and establishes conservation
areas to offset impacts that cannot be completely avoided or mitigated. The industry contributes to
biodiversity conservation programs in partnership with government and non-government
organisations, including the Bush Blitz program in the Northern Territory.
The MCA supports a flexible and responsive security bond system that incentivises good
environmental performance and progressive rehabilitation by reducing the size of the bond.
Operators can reinvest these savings in innovative technologies and ongoing rehabilitation. The
mining industry acknowledges that there are legacy sites that need to be rehabilitated and contributes
significantly to these through the Rehabilitation Security Levy.
Land access is critical to industry growth. A fair and strategic approach to developing compatible and
complementary uses benefits land-owners, mineral and pastoral lessees and other land managers.
Land access processes should be efficient, transparent and consider all land use values including
cultural connection, conservation, agriculture and mineral production.
Investing in strategic infrastructure and attracting investors
Development and expansion of commerce-enabling infrastructure will increase the attractiveness of
the Northern Territory to investment and unlock further growth in regional and remote locations.
Lack of infrastructure in Northern Australia is a major barrier to minerals industry growth. The impact
of inadequate public infrastructure flows through to the broader economy and society. Inefficient
transport infrastructure increases the cost of doing business and limits exports. Inefficient public
infrastructure makes it difficult to attract and retain workers and their families in remote and regional
areas of the Northern Territory.
The government has a role to play in public, common-user and shared infrastructure. Long-term
investments in commerce-enabling infrastructure can promote other investment.
The MCA NT applauds recent commitments by both the Commonwealth and Northern Territory
governments to seal and upgrade a number of remote roads that service a range of industries.
Government investment in transport, water, energy and other critical infrastructure will significantly
enhance the attractiveness of remote areas in the Northern Territory to investors in mining as well as
other industries including tourism, agriculture and pastoralism thereby further generate employment.
Recommendations
•

Through establishment of a multi-disciplinary working group comprising government and
industry representatives, develop a priority list of investments, maximising return on
investment across industries

•

Northern Territory Government and industry to work together to pursue Commonwealth
funding through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (for concessional loans) and
other initiatives

•

Northern Territory Government and industry to pursue jointly-funded infrastructure projects,
through private-public partnerships across industries with similar needs.

Stimulate greater industry investment in exploration
To stimulate greater industry investment in exploration, governments must invest in geotechnical
studies to narrow the search for prospective deposits, water and energy sources.
Geoscience Australia estimates around 80 per cent of Australia remains under-explored, in including
in the Northern Territory. In May 2016 the Commonwealth Government committed an extra $100
million to stimulate exploration through mapping mineral, energy and groundwater potential.
The Northern Territory Geological Survey’s Creating Opportunities for Resource Exploration (CORE)
program provides interpreted data on the prospectively of various regions of the Northern Territory.

Minerals Council of Australia | 34

Investment such as this recognises the critical importance of the minerals industry to future economic
growth and prosperity. By providing data that suggest highly prospective areas for mineral
exploration, governments can promote prospective projects and increase investor confidence by
narrowing their search (i.e., de-risking investment).
A 2015 ACIL Allen Consultants report indicated that for every dollar invested in pre-competitive
106
programs, the rate of return on investment is 20 to 1.
Australia ranks second in the world at
converting exploration into mineral discoveries. Exploration has multiple benefits in generating
valuable data not only on target metal and non-metal resources, but also on ground and surface
water, and flora and fauna.
Recommendations
•

Secure funding for priority surveys in the NT through the Commonwealth’s ‘Exploring for the
Future’ initiative

•

Adequately fund the NT Geological Survey, so it can continue to generate priority
geoscientific datasets to attract greater exploration investment in the Territory

•

Work with mineral companies to identify priority areas and types of surveys to attract further
investment.

•

Renew the Territory’s focus on attracting investment and promoting development through a
targeted marketing campaign and updated vision statement

•

Provide dedicated project facilitators to assist investors in navigating and meeting regulatory
requirements

•

Collaborate and support industry to redress misinformation about the value of the minerals.

What are fuel tax credits?
Fuel excise was introduced in Australia in the 1920s for the
specific purpose of road construction and maintenance.
Rebates for fuel excise are a longstanding feature of Australia’s tax system,
existing in various forms for diesel since
excise was extended to diesel in 1957.
In 1982 the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme
(DFRS) was introduced, which enabled
eligible users to claim back excise
through the completion and submission
of relevant forms to government.
The DFRS was limited to primary
producers, miners, users of diesel
for heating, lighting, hot water, airconditioning and cooking for domestic
purposes and for diesel fuel used at
hospitals and aged care homes.
From 1 July 2000 the DFRS was extended
to rail and marine transport. Rebate rates,
which had varied according to use, were
made equal for all eligible activities.
The Fuel Tax Credit Coalition:

The fuel tax credit system was introduced
in 2006. It is a simple mechanism. Excise
is paid at the pump and refunded through
Business Activity Statements.

Imposing a tax on fuel
– a vital input for many
businesses – would add to
business costs and create
economic distortions.
Fuel tax credits are available to all
businesses, in all parts of Australia.
It is a long-standing policy principle
that governments do not tax business
inputs. Imposing a tax on fuel – a vital
input for many businesses – would
add to business costs and create
job uncertainty.

Why are there
fuel tax credits?

Agriculture relies on on-farm diesel use

The purpose of the fuel
tax credits scheme is to
remove the effect of fuel
tax on business inputs; the
same tax policy principle
that underpins the GST.

Hayden Cudmore, Griffith NSW

Fuel tax credits also recognise that
excise is an implicit road-user charge
originally introduced to fund public
roads. Farmers operate vehicles and
machinery on farms not public roads.
Miners fund and build private roads.

‘There isn’t a
single day I don’t
use diesel on-farm
in some way.’

Fuel tax credits further recognise that
excise should not apply to the use of
fuel in electricity generation because
excise is targeted at transport use of
fuels - not electricity generation,
heating or other applications.
Fuel tax credits are claimed by a range
of industries and by households. They are
vital to the competitiveness of industries
operating in regional Australia.
Large export earning industries such as
mining, agriculture, fishing, forestry and
tourism rely on diesel to operate heavy
machinery off-road and to operate in
remote areas off the electricity grid.
Any changes to existing fuel tax credit
arrangements would amount to a new
tax on regional and rural Australia
and would hit industries and jobs in
Northern Australia particularly hard.

‘We use a large amount of diesel in our
business,’ Hayden says. ‘Preparation of
land for farming, harvesting crops and
simply driving the ute around the farm

‘There’s not a single day I don’t use
diesel on-farm in some way.’
Diesel pumps underwrite a back-up

‘Linked to the dam, they can pump water
to crops if and when they need it,’ he says.

‘We might spend around $80,000 a year
on diesel. It’s a significant business input.’
He recently invested in a diesel pump
to help mitigate high electricity prices.
The certainty around the fuel tax credits
scheme underpins that investment.
‘Farmers can’t control commodity
prices. We compete in a global market.
Any measures to keep costs down are
important to our bottom line.’
‘Australians are the most efficient rice
growers in the world. But we operate on
the slimmest of margins.
‘Getting rid of fuel tax credits would
increase our costs, further undermine
our competitive capacity, impact on our
ability to continue employing staff and
basically make it difficult to stay farming.’

Fuel tax credits
are not a subsidy
Treasury has categorically
rejected the view that the
fuel tax credit scheme
amounts to a ‘subsidy’.

Case study 2

Diesel makes remote worksites viable
Newmont Asia Pacific, Tanami Desert, Northern Territory

In its 2011 submission to the G20
Energy Experts Group, Treasury stated:
‘Fuel tax credits are not a subsidy
for fuel use, but a mechanism to
reduce or remove the incidence of
excise or duty levied on the fuel
used by business off road or in
heavy on-road vehicles.’

‘99 per cent of this
equipment never
leaves site or goes
on a public road.’

A senior Treasury official told a Senate
hearing in June 2014:
‘… the principal rationale behind
the fuel tax credit system … was to
ensure that a number of industries
that used fuel off road were not
subject to double tax.’
Further, the fuel tax credit scheme is
not classified as industry assistance
by the Productivity Commission. In the
Trade and Assistance Review 2013-14,
the Productivity Commission concluded:
‘The estimated effective rate
of assistance from tariff and
budgetary assistance for mining
is negligible.’
A research note from the Parliamentary
Library also directly stated that fuel tax
credits are not a subsidy:
‘…the rebate for excise paid on
fuel that eligible businesses use
as inputs is not a subsidy to fuel
use. Rather, the rebate is designed
to relieve businesses of input taxes
that can reduce output and living
standards.’

Newmont’s Tanami gold operation is one of Australia’s most
remote mine sites located in the Tanami Desert in
the Northern Territory.
Its nearest neighbour is the remote
Aboriginal community of Yuendumu,
some 270 kms away.
The mine is situated on Aboriginal
freehold land owned by the Warlpiri
people and managed on their behalf
by the Central Desert Aboriginal
Lands Trust. Due to its remoteness,
the workforce of approximately 750
personnel is all fly-in, fly-out.
‘Power costs equate to approximately
a quarter of the fixed running costs of
the operation,’ Jarrod Riley, Manager
Sustainability and External Relations Tanami Operations says.
In 2014 Newmont Tanami produced
over 167,000 MWh, which consumed
more than 41 million litres of diesel.

Almost 13 million litres of diesel was
used operating equipment, including
22 underground dump trucks, six
underground boggers (loaders), four
underground drills, seven integrated
tool carriers, three agitator trucks,
10 wheeled loaders, two water carts,
five 50 seater buses, five graders,
four excavators, five roadtrains and
more than 50 light vehicles.
‘Removal of the fuel tax credits,
particularly to a remote operation so
reliant on diesel, will greatly impact
profitability. This impact will then
flow on to both the Northern Territory
Government and the Traditional Owners
through lower royalty payments,’
Jarrod says.

Diesel underpins maritime industries

‘[T]he government does not consider
the diesel fuel rebate as a subsidy at all
… It is recognition that you should not
charge businesses an effective road-user
charge if they do not use public roads.’
Senator the Hon. Mathias Cormann

Australia relies on sea
transport for 99 per cent
of its exports and a quarter
of domestic freight is
moved by ship to service
geographically diverse
populations and industries.
More than 5,000 cargo ships made a
total of 38,073 calls at Australian ports
in 2012-13 and 1.26 billion tonnes of
cargo moved across Australian wharves.
Tasmania is particularly reliant on
shipping to transport imports and
exports to and from domestic and
international markets.
‘Any increase in fuel cost will directly
affect the cost of shipping goods across
Bass Strait and increases the cost
burden on Tasmanian businesses and
the community,’ Chief Executive Officer
of Maritime Industry Australia Ltd,
Teresa Lloyd, says.
Across Australia more than 64 ports
require a range of on-water services,
tugboats and dredges particularly to
keep our channels clear and ports
accessible. Without tugs, Australian
ports come to a halt.
Increasing the cost of running these
essential services increases the cost
of doing business in Australia.

Bipartisan support
for fuel tax credits

‘The cost to the towage sector is
estimated to be more than $11 million per
annum if fuel tax credits are abolished.
‘This cost would have to be passed
on; ultimately to the consumers who
buy the goods that arrive by ship and
trading partners purchasing our bulk
commodities,’ Teresa says.
Also affected by fuel cost rises is the
broader maritime industry in Australia,
including:
• Offshore oil and gas sector vessels
• Cruise and tourism vessels
• Remote community supply vessels
• On-water defence and border
protection activities.
‘Australian maritime businesses operate
with Australian overheads and from an
Australian cost base,’ Teresa says. ‘But
they compete in a global market. Any
increases in costs undermine the idea
that Australia is “open for business”.’

‘Unjustifiably taxing business
inputs is inefficient. It distorts investment
decisions, affects Australia’s export
competitiveness and creates uncertainty
for businesses large and small.’
The Hon. Gary Gray AO MP
‘[T]here are no fossil fuel subsidies in our
tax system … The diesel fuel rebate has
the effect of preventing the taxation of a

principle of good taxation policy … There
is no preferential treatment for the
resources industry in our tax system…’
Senator the Hon. Sam Dastiyari
‘[E]ach year Treasury compile what is
called a Tax Expenditures Statement,
a summary of all the reductions in tax
rates we provide to particular sectors
and how much that costs the budget …
It is very important to note that, while
that document is not per se about
subsidies themselves, Treasury do not
include the diesel fuel tax rebate as
part of their assessment … [C]onsistent
with Treasury practice, the Productivity
Commission do not measure or estimate
the fuel tax rebate as a subsidy. They
have had ample opportunity to do so
over many years.’

‘If fuel tax credits were

David Carter

Austral Fisheries, WA

Fuel excise is an implicit road user charge.
That is why a ‘road-user charge’ applies to
businesses using public roads in the form
of reduced fuel tax credits.
As the Henry Review stated:
‘This combination of annual motor vehicle
registration and fuel excise could be viewed
as a crude ‘two-part tariff’ for road usage.
While road taxes are not hypothecated (that
is, earmarked) to road spending, revenue
from these taxes does cover the direct cost
of infrastructure spending on roads
and bridges...’

FACT

All businesses have an incentive to
minimise costs including by limiting
fuel usage.
Diesel is an essential business input
that cannot be avoided for use in many
regional businesses. Large agricultural
and mining equipment, ships, fishing
vessels and ferries require diesel.
Businesses and homes in remote areas
off the electricity grid rely on diesel
generators.
