Dear Senators,

Subject: Senate Economics References Committee — Regional Inequality in Australia.

| apologise for this late correspondence. | was unaware that your committee was undertaking an
enquiry into regional inequality in Australia and have missed the closing date for submissions. |
would still like to provide a brief comment on an area that could bring major financial benefits to
regional Queensland at no cost to Federal or State budgets. That area is the formula used to
calculate payments to local government through the annual federal government financial assistance
grants.

FAG payments were legislated with bipartisan support in 1974. The bill stated “The government's
aim is that the Grants Commission should play the same role in reducing local government
authorities’ inequalities as it has between the States since 1933. In accordance with the principles of
financial equalisation which have been developed by the grants commission over many years and
which have been incorporated in the relevant legislation, the grants are designed to reduce
inequalities between local government bodies in the provision of ordinary services” The Opposition
of the day supported the bill. “The Opposition supports this legislation — not because it represents
an adequate response to the financial problems of local government, but because the funds
proposed will be of assistance to those municipal bodies which are at a comparative
disadvantage.”

Fiscal equalisation is a transfer of fiscal resources across jurisdiction with the aim of offsetting
differences in revenue raising capacity.

Using population as a factor in calculating allocations to the 77 Queensland Councils has deviated
payments away from the original intention of the grant. | am making my comparison with Blackall-
Tambo Council which was amalgamated in 2009 and covers an area of over 30,000 square
kilometres with Brisbane City Council which covers an area of 1343 square kilometres. There are
many rural Councils the size of Blackall-Tambo that could be used for comparison and attachments
of Grants Commission allocations for 2007/2008 and ten years later 2017/2018 are attached.

Submission 125

2007/2008 Blackall Tambo General Purpose Grant S 2,707,147.00
Blackall Tambo Identified Road Grant S$ 897,644.00
Brisbane City General Purpose Grant $17,825,262.00
Brisbane City Identified Road Grant $11,651,852.00

Ten years later:

2017/2018 Blackall-Tambo General Purpose Grant $ 2,881,271.00
Blackall-Tambo Identified Road Grant $ 1,094,821.00
Brisbane City General Purpose Grant $24,005,964.00
Brisbane City Identified Road Grant $15,619,716.00

Over ten years Brisbane City Councils allocation has increased significantly. 7.3% of the total general
purpose grant pool is paid to them. Over 11.0% of the identified road grant pool goes to Brisbane.

Attachment 3 shows the budgeted general rates for Queensland councils estimated for 2018/2019.

Blackall-Tambo Council estimates revenue of $2.9Million, Brisbane City Council estimates
$788Million.

Why is such a large proportion of the Financial Assistance Grant being paid to a Council that
obviously has significant revenue raising capacity?

If the Federal government made a change to methodology on distribution to grants that capped the
maximum payment to any one Council at 5%, Brisbane City’s general allocation would reduce to
$16,404,000.00 and road allocation to $6,820,000.00. This would place $7.6Million general and
$8.8Million road grant funds back into the pool. A 3% or 4% cap would be more appropriate
considering there are 77 Councils.

Alternately, government could look at the rating capacity of Councils and whether FAG funding is
appropriate or necessary. Councils currently budgeting to levy over 100Million in general rates are:

Brisbane City Council $788M
Cairns Regional Council $106M
Gold Coast City Council $418M
Ipswich City Council $150M
Logan City Council $129M
Mackay Regional Council $102M

Moreton Bay Regional Council $224M
Sunshine Coast Regional Council $205M

Toowoomba Regional Council $116M

Townsville Regional Council $144M

The financial assistance and roads grant allocation to Queensland was over $464Million in
2017/2018.

There are 77 Councils that benefit from this grant. 31 Councils receive total grants under $4Million,
most in areas that are being looked at by your committee. As previously stated this is an area that
could bring significant financial assistance to regional Queensland at no extra cost to Federal or State
governments.
