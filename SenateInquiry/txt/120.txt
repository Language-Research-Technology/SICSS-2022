Inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia

Introduction
The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (the Department)
welcomes the opportunity to provide a submission to the Senate Economics
References Committee for the Inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of,
regional inequality in Australia.
The Department notes the Committee has the following Terms of Reference
(TOR):
a) Fiscal policies at federal, state and local government levels
b) Improved co-ordination of federal, state and local government policies
c) Regional development policies
d) Infrastructure
e) Education
f)

Building human capital

g) Enhancing local workforce skills
h) Employment arrangements
i)

Decentralisation policies

j)

Innovation

k) Manufacturing
l)

Any other related matters.

And in particular would like submissions answering the following specific
questions on:
1) Experiences of individuals and localities of unequal access to
opportunities and unequal outcomes in non-metropolitan areas
2) Views on the causes of inequality between regions, especially between
capital cities and other areas
3) Analysis of the economics of regional inequality, including wider
impacts
4) Examples of solutions: what has caused some regions or towns to
prosper?
5) Policy settings which could help address inequality between regions.
In this submission we begin by addressing regional development and transition
policies (ToRa, ToRb, ToRk, ToRj). We then answer some questions about the
differences in
economic
activity
between regions and
what
characteristics/attributes are driving changes in economic activity and these
regional differences (ToRl and specific questions 2, 3). As part of this
discussion, the role of skills in driving economic activity is covered (ToR e–g).

We then consider regional vulnerability and the role of a region’s industry
structure in making it more or less vulnerable (ToRl, ToRa, ToRb, ToRk and
specific question 4). Finally, the role of innovation within regions is discussed
in relation to the performance of regions (ToRl, ToRj and specific questions 2,
3 and 4).

Regional assistance and development
policies
(Addresses Terms of Reference a, b, j and k)
The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science facilitates the growth and
productivity of globally competitive industries. It also supports the building of a
strong scientific capability, business innovation, and the commercialisation of
new ideas as critical requirements for productivity and economic growth. The
Department is part of the Jobs and Innovation Portfolio and its role is to drive
growth and job creation for a more prosperous Australia by facilitating
economic transformation and boosting business competitiveness.
The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (the Department) has a
broad regional presence through its networks and agencies. The Department
has 35 per cent of staff located outside Canberra in 31 locations around
Australia.
The Department’s policies and programs aim to assist businesses, including
regional businesses, to build their capability, innovate and grow. The programs
the Department administers vary in how they support Australian businesses.
Some programs seek to assist communities affected by losing an important
local employer through supporting businesses to invest and diversify into
identified potential opportunities for growth such as new products and new
markets. The Growth Fund, Automotive Transformation Scheme (ATS), and
the Advanced Manufacturing Fund provide such assistance.
The Growth Fund is a $155 million package of industry support measures.
The Fund is a sector specific measure to support employees and businesses
in regions such as Northern Adelaide, South East Melbourne, and South
Western Victoria that have been most affected by Australia’s car manufacturing
closure. The fund assists employees transition to new jobs, helps automotive
supply chain firms diversify into new products, industries, and markets, and will
accelerate business investment in manufacturing.
The Automotive Transformation Scheme provides businesses involved in
Australia’s automotive industry with grants to cover some of the cost of
investing in plant and equipment, or in research and development. The ATS
seeks to encourage investment, innovation and economic sustainability in the
Australian automotive industry. Stage 2 (2016 to 2020) is capped at $1billion.
The Advanced Manufacturing Fund is a $100 million package that seeks to
improve innovation, skills, and employment in Australia’s advanced
manufacturing sector. The fund comprises six elements to achieve this
outcome with the largest being the $47.5 million Advanced Manufacturing
Growth Fund. The Advanced Manufacturing Growth Fund is available to

businesses affected by the wind down of the local car manufacturing industry
in South Australia and Victoria.
Box 1: Example 1
Carbon Revolution Pty Ltd was awarded a Geelong Region Innovation and
Investment Fund grant of $5 million to support the establishment of a commercial
scale manufacturing facility to produce up to 50,000 carbon fibre wheels annually
for supply to the global automotive industry. Carbon Revolution is the first company
in the world to commercialise a single piece carbon fibre wheel. Current customers
include Ford (United States), along with many performance, racing and aftermarket
vehicle companies.

Other programs administered by the department seek to build industry
capability so Australian businesses can succeed in new or changing markets.
The Industry Growth Centres, the Entrepreneurs’ Program, the Cooperative
Research Centre (CRC), and Centre for Defence Industry Capability (CDIC)
initiatives are some of the larger Commonwealth programs that seek to assist
individual businesses or industry sectors develop capabilities, boost skills and
productivity, and improve their competitiveness so they can succeed in
international markets. These programs are not restricted by geographic
location.
The Industry Growth Centre Initiative is a $232 million program that supports
six industry sectors improve their innovation, productivity and competitiveness
by:


improving management capabilities and workforce skills within each growth
sector



increasing collaboration between industry and researchers so new ideas
are commercialised



accessing international markets and global supply chains



optimising regulations that affect each growth sector.

While not region exclusive, the Mining Equipment, Technology and Services
Growth Centre, the Oil, Gas and Energy Resources Growth Centre, and the
Food and Agribusiness Growth Centre are three Growth Centres that will
benefit regional business and communities as each sector has a large regional
footprint.

Box 2: Example 2
The Food and Agribusiness Growth Centre, Food Innovation Australia Limited
(FIAL)’s Fast n Furious Innovation short course and post workshop mentoring
assisted Fresh Fodder Pty Ltd’s owners to make changes to their business
strategy. The business advice assisted Fresh Fodder to innovate their core range of
products. They did this by focusing on branding, distribution channels and shelf
visibility as part of their business strategy. Within a year, Fresh Fodder had
increased revenue for their range of products by 17 per cent.

The Entrepreneurs’ Programme is a Commonwealth initiative that seeks to
improve firm level competitiveness and productivity. The Entrepreneurs’
Program provides businesses with a range of services including: advice, grants
to commercialise ideas, funding to take advantage of growth opportunities, and
connection and collaboration opportunities. To provide better support for
regionally based start-ups, the incubator support element of the Entrepreneurs’
Program has been expanded. The expansion includes additional support
services such as introducing Regional Incubator Facilitators to assist regional
applicants engage with the program, and more generous funding ratios for
regional projects.
Box 3: Example 3
The Entrepreneurs’ Programme Supply Chain Facilitation supported Skara
Smallgoods Pty Ltd to develop a new marketing strategy, develop a plan for new
products, and build productivity within the company through targeted staff training
and development.
Since engaging with the Entrepreneurs’ Programme the Skara Smallgoods has
increased sales by 30 per cent and wholesale sales (mainly into supermarkets) by
94 per cent. The business recently won awards at the 2017 South Australian Food
Industry Awards.

The Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Program is a competitive meritbased grant program that supports industry led collaborations between
industry, researchers and the community. The CRC Program has two funding
streams:


CRCs, which undertake medium to long term industry led collaborative
research; and



CRC Projects (CRC-Ps) which undertake a short term industry identified
and industry led collaborative research project.

CRCs and CRC-Ps contribute to strengthening rural and regional development
in areas such as our agriculture and mining industries, farming systems, and in
improving health outcomes for Indigenous Australians. Regional businesses
(including small and medium-sized enterprises), Rural Research and

Development Corporations, universities and other research organisations can
be part of CRCs, CRC-Ps, and their activities.
The CRC for developing Northern Australia is one example of how the
Department’s programs are assisting regional communities. It is a $75 million
initiative that is focused on agriculture, food and tropical health. It aims to assist
businesses, researchers, and governments to work more collaboratively to
identify opportunities for business and growth in Northern Australia.
Box 4: Example 4
A two-year Smart Supply Chains project funded by the Cooperative Research
Centre (CRC) for Developing Northern Australia will help Australian mango farmers
increase profits, exports, investment and jobs. Northern Australian mango farmers
are trialing a new Smart Supply Chains system to improve the quality control of
mangos throughout the supply chain, help producers overcome logistical
challenges and speed up the harvest-to-retail cycle so consumers get fresher
produce.

The Centre for Defence Industry Capability (CDIC) is a $230 million package
intended to fund defence industry development, skilling and export initiatives.
The CDIC uses a network of advisors which extend to regional areas. The
CDIC seeks to:


support new and established defence companies



involve region based activities in trade shows, related industry events and
communication strategies



connect businesses with opportunities in other sectors, markets and
international opportunities, and exchange information with region based
defence industry development agencies on current and emerging industrial
capabilities to aid developing and delivering support programs.

The Department also manages a number of large government projects and
programs that are regionally based or exclusively aimed at regionally based
businesses or communities. These initiatives provide benefit by way of
infrastructure investments, attracting business investment and creating jobs in
specific regional project locations. The Tasmanian Jobs and Investment
Fund and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility are two region
exclusive programs designed to stimulate business growth and jobs.

Box 5: Example 5
In February 2016 CostaExchange Pty Ltd received a grant of $1.4 million matched
by the company’s own contribution of $5.7 million to construct a new modified
atmosphere facility and a new building at its Tasmanian Distribution Centre in
Devonport in north west Tasmania. This has allowed the company to double its
previous capacity to store berries for up to six weeks at a time and allows the
season to be extended and for products to be sold into markets at a time when
there were traditionally only imports available. The increased capacity will also
allow CostaExchange Pty Ltd to increase berry plantings on its Tasmanian farms.
The Company’s project was completed in September 2017 and has resulted in the
engagement of 90 new, full time equivalent employees (FTE’s), all of whom are
permanent employees spread across the company’s Tasmanian farms and the
Distribution Centre. These roles include farm management and maintenance
positions, supervisory roles, horticulturalists and irrigation specialists.
CostaExchange Pty Ltd has indicated that it is on track to increase this to 130 new
FTE positions by September 2018.

Other Commonwealth projects and programs that benefit regional communities
and businesses include the National Radioactive Waste Management
Facility, the Rum Jungle Rehabilitation Project, the Square Kilometre
Array Project, the Onshore Gas Social and Economic Research Fund, and
National Resources Development Strategy, the Northern Australian
Tourism Initiative, the Major Projects Facilitation Agency, and the National
Carp Control Plan.
The department also assists regional businesses and communities develop
future workplace skills and knowledge for tomorrow’s industries. This is
provided via a number of programs that seek to build Science, Technology,
Engineering and Maths capabilities throughout the nation. These programs
are not region exclusive and are available to regional and urban communities
and businesses. Measures include Questacon’s Smart Skills Initiative, Virtual
Excursions, Travelling exhibitions, Teacher development programs, and the
Shell Questacon Science Circus.

Regional differences in economic activity
(Addresses Terms of Reference l and specific questions 2, 3)
There are many economic and demographic indicators that are used to analyse
a region’s economic performance and growth (e.g. employment, population
growth, investment). The Department uses these but has also developed two
additional indicators—Gross Regional Product and a time series of taxable
incomes. One is a production measure the other is an income measure.
Box 6: What we mean by ‘Gross Regional Product’ and ‘Taxable Income’
Gross Regional Product is a measure of the size of a region’s economy or the total
of all value added created in an economy. It is measured as the total value of goods
and services produced in a region within a specific time period less the cost of
goods and services used up in the process of production but before deducting
allowances for the consumption of fixed capital.
On the other hand, “taxable income” is the income an individual needs to pay tax
on. It is the gross income of an individual less any allowable tax deductions (i.e. the
amount of income that is subject to income tax). Taxable incomes for individuals
living in a region are then added together to provide a regional estimate.

Gross Regional Product and taxable income are discussed further below.

Gross Regional Product
The first measure developed by the Department is Gross Regional Product
(GRP). The Department has estimated GRP in the financial years of 2001,
2006, 2011 and 2016. This data allows analysis of how the spatial distribution
of the Australian economy has been changing over time, as well as factors that
are driving these changes. Results from this analysis are briefly summarised
below, with full results at Attachment A. GRP is also calculated by a number
of private firms, whose findings are in broad agreement with the Department’s.
GRP has been concentrating steadily in the centre parts of the larger capital
cities since at least the turn of the century. CBDs of capital cities now contribute
a quarter of national economic activity, despite accounting for less than 0.05
per cent of Australia’s land mass. When this is extended to include capital cities
in their entirety, two thirds of economic activity can be accounted for.
Figure 1 shows that since 2000-01, capital cities have grown by an average of
3.2 per cent per year while non-capital city regions have grown at 2.5 per cent.
In cumulative terms, two thirds of economic growth has been in capital cities.
However, the story is more complex than a capital city/regional area divide.
Some of the fastest growing regions in Australia are outside the capital cities.
The average growth of mining regions since the turn of the century, for
example, has been at 5.9 per cent per year. On the other hand, some of the
slowest growing regions are in the outer northern suburbs in Sydney and outer

at the turn of the century.

Taxable Income
The second measure developed by the Department relates to taxable income.
This indicator measures incomes accruing to taxpayers from any source, e.g.
wages and salaries, business income, dividends, government pensions and
allowances. Real Income Per Taxpayer (RIPT) is calculated by dividing a
region’s total taxable income by the number of taxpayers.1 It is not the average
income for a region but an indicator of the average income of economically
active individuals within a region. Taxable income data has the advantage over
GRP of a longer time period and better geographic precision.
RIPT can be used to measure the variability of taxable income between
regions. There are a number of ways of doing this and the coefficient of
variation is used here. This measure shows the extent of the variation of
regional RIPT from the mean (or national average) each year. Since RIPT is
an average regional measure (i.e. not an individual measure), the coefficient of

variation cannot be used to show the variation in incomes of individuals within
or across regions. Rather it is an average regional variation measure.
Figure 2 shows that the relative variation of average incomes from the mean
has been steadily increasing over time, indicating an increasing number of
regions that are above or below the national average. However, during
economic downturns such as the 1989-90 recession and the Asian Financial
Crisis/Dot Com Crash in 2000, the variation between regions did reduce. This
is because regions with higher incomes tend to be more sensitive to changes
in national GDP than regions with lower incomes and fall back towards the
mean in a downturn.2 Medium and lower income regions tend more to be
counter cyclical. The increase in regional variability does not appear to have
occurred during the Global Financial Crisis in 2007–2009.

Figure 3 shows changes in the distribution of RIPT between 1980–81 and
2015–16. RIPT has increased for all regions in Australia since 1990–91.3
Regions with the lowest average incomes grew particularly strongly during the
2000–01 and 2010–11 time period. The shape of the distribution has also
changed significantly over time; peaks are flattening and the right hand side tail
is widening. This indicates that regions with higher RIPT have been growing

The whole income distribution shifted to the left between 1980–81 and 1990–91 as a result of the
1990s recession. However, the right hand side of the distribution steepens indicating that higher
income regions were most affected. There is also a kick out on the left hand side due to the
increasing unemployment in low income regions

faster over time than regions with lower average incomes. These higher
average income regions are predominantly located in the larger capital cities.
One exception is the Pilbara mining region in Western Australia which has had
consistently high average incomes.

The RIPT data also confirms the GRP story that there is no simple city/country
divide in income growth. Some of the regions with the lowest average incomes
are in greater capital city areas (e.g. Adelaide – North in South Australia and
Logan – Beaudesert in Queensland) and there are many non-capital city
regions with relatively high average incomes (e.g. Western Australia – Outback
North and Central Queensland).
In summary, both GRP and RIPT show that economic value in Australia is
concentrating in the centre of capital cities. However, the story is more complex
than simple urban/non-urban averages would suggest.

What is driving economic activity to capital
cities?
(Addresses Terms of Reference l, e–g and specific questions 2, 3)
Attachment A explores some of the forces shaping the regional geography in
Australia. It is briefly summarised below.

Knowledge-intensive industries
Part of this shift of economic activity to Australia’s cities has been occurring
due to the overarching structural shift in the economy away from goods
producing industries to services industries. As consumers’ incomes increase,
services make up a larger proportion of their demand. Larger cities have an

Inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia

10

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 120

Inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia

intrinsic advantage in service supply because they provide economies of
agglomeration that makes service provision more cost effective than smaller
centres.4 A large urban law firm, for example, can offer a larger range of
services than a firm in a smaller town because of potential access to a larger
number of clients.
In particular, it is the knowledge-intensive service industries that are key drivers
of productivity and economic growth in Australia’s capital cities. Embedded
services are becoming a larger proportion of the physical transformation of
goods. The mining industry for example now has knowledge–based services
embedded in its entire value chain. Falling communication costs have allowed
the ‘thinking’ and the ‘doing’ part of the production process to become
physically separated. To continue the mining example, the physical extraction
of ore can happen thousands of kilometres from the marketing, finance and
logistic services.
Production in areas outside capital cities typically involves population-serving
industries such as health care, education and public administration (there are
of course exceptions such as regions that specialise in activities of competitive
advantage).5 These population-serving industries tend to produce relatively
lower levels of economic activity than knowledge-intensive services industries.
This is because these are non-market sectors and goods and services are often
provided “free of charge or heavily subsidised due to significant government
involvement”.6 The lack of a market price in these sectors mean that estimates
are based on the total cost of inputs and not an observable market output
price.7

Trade
Trade provides new market opportunities for domestic firms, stronger
productivity and innovation through competition.8 Openness to trade can partly
explain why economic activity concentrates in some areas and not in others.
Australia is currently experiencing Globalisation Mark 29 and international
two-way trade in goods and services is around 40 per cent of the economy.

Major nodes in the network such as the larger capital cities supply the services
required for this trade such as finance, logistics, customs, insurance etc. Areas
towards the periphery of the network such as rural area of regional centres do
not have the scale to add significant value.10

Talent and skills
Capital cities and major regional centres are also attracting talent and skills.
The working age cohort is migrating to areas around CBDs or to major regional
centres along the east coast. In cities, job-search costs are lower, matches are
better and wages typically higher as a result of the greater productivity of firms
from the spill overs associated with concentration.11 Immigrants also favour
cities due to greater job opportunities and existing cultural networks. 12
Economic concentration helps to deepen labour markets and provides greater
education opportunities — which in turn results in greater migration to these
areas. As with the previous measures, the story is more complex than a
city/country story. This is also discussed in detail in Attachment A.

Transaction costs
Transaction costs can have a major impact on the value flow through regions.
Freight costs in Australia have not fallen for 25 years on any mode.13 At the
same time, communication costs have fallen steeply. Regions where freight
costs are a significant part of firms’ production costs, such as many non-metro
regions, are more affected by high transport costs than regions where freight
is a smaller proportion of their firms’ cost base, typically urban regions. On the
other hand, falling communication costs benefit knowledge intensive city based
service industries more because it is a bigger part of their cost base.

Structural change and regional vulnerability
(Addresses Terms of Reference l, k, a and b and specific question 4)
The Department’s 2016 Australian Industry Report explored the impact of
structural change on the performance of regions. Structural change is typically
defined as shifts (usually permanent or long-term) in the distribution of output,

investment and employment across industries or regions. 14 Regions can
benefit or be vulnerable to structural change or external shocks. Some regions
benefit from structural change, particularly when it is driven by growth in
important local industries (for instance, “mining” regions benefited from the
recent commodity price boom). Conversely, some regions are negatively
influenced by it, particularly when they bear the cost of industrial decline. For
example, the end of automotive manufacturing has had an impact on the
economies of Melbourne and Adelaide.
How a region responds to structural change or external shocks depends on a
complex mix of social and economic factors. In its recent study into transitioning
regional economies, the Productivity Commission 15 developed a measure of
the relative adaptive capacity of regions, as this is thought to influence the
resilience of regions. The following factors are considered to influence the
capacity of regions to be resilient:


Skills and education of regional workforces



Access to infrastructure and services



Availability of natural resources



Availability of financial resources to businesses and individuals



Industry diversity. Generally speaking, regions with a diverse industrial
structure are more resilient when dealing with structural change or external
shocks. The Productivity Commission cautions though that diversification
should not always be pursued for its own sake as there can be large
benefits to a region from focusing resources in a few highly profitable
activities or industries.16

Major cities have a diverse industry structure and consequently have a
relatively higher adaptive capacity than most remote or outer regional areas.
This has implications for how regions can transition following changes in
Australia’s economy or industry structure. These results also have implications
for the shifting of economic activity to capital cities.
The Government has provided assistance through structural adjustment
programs or packages delivered in specific regions. The packages have arisen
following closures of key regional employers or the restructuring of businesses
and industries that impacted regional economies. Such packages have been
considered on a case-by-case basis and taken into account factors such as the
expected magnitude of the job losses and the underlying resilience of the local

economy. The packages have provided a timely injection of confidence into a
local business economy and supported firms to invest and diversify their
operations.
In many cases, these packages have been jointly developed or delivered with
other Commonwealth departments and State governments. There may also be
existing policies or programmes, including those at the Commonwealth, state
and local level, that can assist individuals, firms and regions to adjust.

Regional differences in business and
innovation activity
(Addresses Terms of Reference l, j and specific questions 2, 3 and 4)
Recent work by Reynolds17 has confirmed that there is a strong positive
relationship between the presence of new firms and subsequent increases in
total jobs, economic growth, changes in the economic structure and total factor
productivity. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for net increase in
businesses, show that between 2016 and 2017 the number of businesses in
capital cities grew faster (3.7 per cent growth) than the national average
(3.1 per cent growth). Net business counts also grew in the regions, with the

Economies that exhibit business dynamism, i.e. the rate at which firms enter or
exit the market, also tend to be more productive, adaptable and capable of
sustained economic growth. Innovation and entrepreneurship play an important
role in this process. 18
Innovation is important for long-term economic growth. Successful economies
need to be innovating to increase or maintain competitive advantage.19 A
forthcoming publication20 by the Department shows that most innovation occurs
in the CBD of capital cities. But scaling the results by employment shows the
existence of some regions with greater innovative intensity than the capital
cities. These are often specialist regions devoted to a single activity, like a

innovative businesses.
This research suggests that benefits can accrue to regions that specialise in
areas where they have a competitive advantage (as well as to regions like
capital cities that benefit from agglomeration). So while some regions might be
more vulnerable to structural change or external shocks if they do not have a
diverse industrial base (see discussion above of the Productivity Commission’s
report into Transitioning Regional Economies), diversifying regional economies
for its own sake can preclude regions from accruing benefits through
specialisation.

Summary
The performance of regional economies depend on a complex mix of social
and economic factors. In general, economic growth in cities has been
outstripping that of Australia’s regions. However, the story is more complex
than simple urban/non-urban averages would suggest. There are some city
areas with low or negative economic growth and some regional areas that have
grown very strongly over the past 15 years. Innovative activity (necessary for
sustained economic growth) is occurring both in regional areas and in cities.

The spatial distribution of economic growth

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 120

Over the last quarter of a century, the Australian economy has grown at about
three per cent per year. The experience of Australia’s regions however, has
been far from uniform. The annual growth rate of Melbourne’s central business
district (CBD) was four times higher than the growth rate of Hume 87 in regional
Victoria since 2000–01. During this period, there was also a shift of economic
activity to mineral-rich regions in the investment phase of the mining boom.88
This resulted in Mining regions89 growing faster than capital cities.
Using a new time series of Gross Regional Product (GRP), this chapter explores how
Australia’s economy has changed spatially since 2001 (see Box 3.1). Upon establishing the
spatial distribution of economic growth, the chapter will then turn to why these differences
exist. Factors such as shifting demographics, openness to trade and changing industry
composition can help explain why economic activity concentrates in some areas and not
in others.
The chapter then moves on to discuss the implications of economic concentration in
Australia’s capital cities; persistent comparative inequality in terms of GRP per capita and
difficulty in predicting long-term sources of growth for regional areas. Such concentration
also has implications for cities — in part, the future economic success of Australia will
depend on having cities that can cope with increasing demand for their resources.
Analysis throughout this chapter focuses on sub-state regions known as Statistical Area
Level 4s (SA4s). These boundaries are the largest sub-state regions in the Australian
Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS), as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS). There are 88 SA4s in Australia, with 46 located in greater capital city areas. The
remaining 42 are in regional locations. SA4s are intended to be a proxy for labour markets.
But as the boundaries are also restricted by population limits, they often cut across or
combine labour markets — having implications for regional economic analysis.

The methodology used to derive the experimental estimates of GRP is based on
the work of Queensland Treasury and Trade, which produces GRP estimates for
Queensland regions. Estimates of GRP are derived from the 2015–16 Gross State
Product (GSP) of each State and Territory (published in the State National Accounts),
and based on the income approach of measuring GSP. The income approach is
the sum of incomes earned through the production of goods and services in each
industry, in each State and Territory. The components of the income approach are:
g

g

Compensation of Employees (incomes earned by employees and the selfemployed)
Gross Operating Surplus and Mixed Income (which includes business profits and
imputed rental income through the ownership of dwellings)

Box 3.1: Notes on method used to calculate Gross Regional
Product estimates

Taxes less subsidies.

To allocate GSP to regions, Queensland Treasury and Trade used an apportioning
approach to estimate each SA4’s share of GSP. A similar approach is used to derive
the estimates presented in this chapter.
Head office effects have not been fully accounted for when calculating the
experimental estimates of GRP. Head office effects refer to the recording of business
data (such as profit) in capital cities where head offices are located, rather than in the
region where the economic activity occurred.
Head office effects are more prevalent for some industries than others (e.g. Mining).
To account for head office effects, industry-regional-specific datasets were used
when possible to try and apportion production back to the region where it occurred.
In addition, when calculating SA4-to-state ratios from the Census, ‘place of work’
data was used to try and capture economic activity where it was occurring, rather
than where the individuals earning the incomes lived.
Notes: For a detailed description of methodology please refer to Chapter 7 of the Australian Industry
Report 2016. This method has been extended to previous Census years to create a time series.

The spatial distribution of economic growth

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 120

Between 2000–01 and 2015–16, two key changes occurred to Australia’s economic
geography.
g

g

The first was the concentration of economic activity into the CBDs of capital cities. These
areas now contribute 25 per cent to national economic activity,91 despite accounting for
less than 0.05 per cent of Australia’s land mass.92 Australia is one of the most urbanised
countries on earth, apart from city-states like Monaco and Singapore.93 This favours
Australia’s transition to a knowledge-based economy, as cities create spill overs, deeper
labour markets and economies of scale.
The second major change to Australia’s economic geography was the mining boom.
Between 2000–01 and 2015–16, Australia experienced one of the biggest mining
booms in its history. The Mining industry went from around five per cent of the economy
to close to seven per cent in 2015–16.94 At a regional level, in 2010–11 the Mining
regions of the Bowen Basin, the Pilbara, WA Goldfields and Hunter Valley accounted for
around nine per cent of Australia’s economic activity, compared to almost five per cent in
2000–01. In 2015–16, these regions contributed seven per cent to the Australian
economy.

Generally, the SA4s in the top quartile are located in capital cities. The exception to this
is the Mining regions. Between 2005–06 and 2010–11, the WA outback — home to the
Goldfields and the Pilbara — and areas of the Bowen Basin, were all in the top 25 per
cent.95 The Pilbara region remains in the top 25 per cent, while other mining regions are
in the top 50 per cent. Regions in the third quartile tend to be in outer capital city areas or
along the eastern coast. In 2015–16, SA4s in the top 50 per cent accounted for 77 per cent
of national economic activity and were home to 66 per cent of the population.
Over two-thirds of the SA4 regions in the first and second quartiles (the bottom
50 per cent) consisted of the outback areas of Queensland, SA and the NT, and regions
outside the greater capital city areas of all states. Less than a third of the SA4 regions in
the first and second quartiles were located in greater capital city areas. These consisted of
areas such as the Logan-Beaudesert region in Queensland, Hobart and the Outer South
West of Sydney. In 2015–16 these two quartiles contributed 23 per cent to Australia’s total
economic activity, despite being home to 34 per cent of the population.
The distribution of economic activity within states is consistent with the national story
— each state or territory is driven by its capital city. Figure 3.2 highlights how much the
mining boom affected the resource-intensive states of WA and Queensland, where a large
proportion of economic activity can be attributed to regional areas.
In terms of economic activity, NSW and Victoria dominate, and the same can be said for
their capital cities. Sydney and Melbourne are the two largest capital cities. Combined,
these two areas consistently contribute over 40 per cent to Australia’s economic activity.
In part this can be attributed to their larger populations and the concentration of industries
with relatively high labour productivity.96

Between 2000–01 and 2015–16, the Australian economy grew on average 3 per cent per
year. Despite this, when examining GRP growth over the past 15 years it is evident growth
has not been uniform.

More than two-thirds (70 per cent) of Australia’s growth occurred in capital cities. This
equates to average growth of 3.2 per cent per year.97
A further 11 per cent of national growth was generated in Australia’s Mining regions,
equating to average growth of 5.9 per cent per year.
The remaining 19 per cent of growth was in non-Mining regional areas, equating to
average growth of 2.5 per cent per year.

SA4s growing above the national rate were mainly in the resource-intensive states of
Queensland and WA. Table 3.1 lists the top 10 SA4s in terms of 15–year annual average
GRP growth. The impact of the mining boom on Queensland and WA is evident — both
their capital cities and regional areas experienced higher growth rates. This highlights that
wealth generated by Mining is also captured in cities where the businesses that support
the industry are located.98

The spatial distribution of economic growth

Capital cities growing faster than
regional Australia

The largest 15-year annual average growth occurred in WA — Outback (North), home of the
Pilbara, which grew on average 11 per cent per year. This region now contributes around
$43 billion to the economy (3 per cent of total economic activity). Higher growing SA4s
that are located in capital cities also tended to have a 15-year annual average population
growth rate that was higher than the national average (1.3 per cent).
Table 3.2 lists the 10 SA4s reporting the lowest annual GRP growth. SA4s that experienced
low GRP growth can be characterised by low population growth, and for some a transition
away from the agricultural industry has resulted in little growth. New England and North
West in regional NSW has grown an average of 1.1 per cent per year. In 2000–01 the
largest employing industry in the region was Agriculture — 29 per cent of total employment.
Fast forward to 2015–16 and Agriculture only accounts for 7.8 per cent of employment,
and Health Care is now the largest employing industry — 13.6 per cent. Other SA4s, on
the outer edges of capital cities, had similar experiences with the decline of manufacturing.
Melbourne — Outer East and Adelaide South had growth rates of –1 and 0.6 per cent
respectively. In both instances Manufacturing was the top employing industry, which has
now been overtaken by Heath Care or Construction.
While Health Care is featuring as the largest employing industry in both the top 10
and bottom 10 list of SA4s, the shift to Health Care over the past 15 years has been
more pronounced in the 10 SA4s reporting the lowest annual GRP growth. Health Care
accounted for 9.4 per cent of employment in the top 10 SA4s in 2000–01 and 12.1 per cent in
2015–16. In the bottom 10 SA4s, it accounted for 9.5 per cent in 2000-01 and 13 per cent
in 2015–16.

The difference between the regions becomes particularly evident when examining growth by
region type. Figure 3.3 shows that over the past 15 years, Mining regions have experienced
the fastest growth, an average of 5.9 per cent per year. The annual average growth of
capital cities was slightly above the national rate at 3.2 per cent.99 While non-Mining
regional areas fell below the national rate, growing 2.5 per cent per year. The significant
difference between non-Mining regional areas and Mining regions is demonstrated in
regional Queensland. The SA4 of Mackay-Isaac-Whitsunday, part of the Bowen Basin,
grew on average three times faster than its neighbouring SA4, Queensland-Outback. For
every $1 of economic activity produced in Queensland-Outback, $2 of economic activity
was produced in Mackay-Isaac-Whitsunday.
Growth in capital cities was driven by CBDs. Over 15 years, the economic activity of
these areas nearly doubled — $236 billion in 2000–01 compared to $419 billion in
2015–16 (3.9 per cent per year), making up 29 per cent of Australia’s total economic growth.
Brisbane CBD grew the fastest (6.2 per cent per year). This small area now contributes
around $60 billion to the Australian economy and accounts for nearly 4 per cent of total
economic activity.

It is important to note that GRP growth in capital cities is occurring off a higher base. Since 2000–01, in
absolute terms, there has been much higher growth in GRP in capital cities compared to both Mining and
non-Mining regional areas. Over this period, absolute growth in GRP amounted to more than $430 billion
of additional economic activity in capital cities, compared to around $175 billion in all regional areas.

Box 3.2 will describe the relative movement between SA4s in more detail.

Box 3.2: Regional growth and GRP per capita inequality
The concentration of economic activity in capital cities has implications for individual
regions and the economy as a whole. Over the 15 years, there has been persistent
comparative inequality in terms of GRP per capita. In addition it is difficult to predict
long-term sources of growth for regional areas. In contrast, income growth has been
comparable across cities and regions. But as economic activity continues to shift
to capital cities, there will also be pressure on infrastructure, and cities will need to
adjust to growing demands.

The spatial distribution of economic growth

Also evident in Figure 3.3 is that the rate of growth is slowing for all regions. For each
five-year period, capital cities have consistently grown faster than regional areas and the
difference between the two is increasing. Overall, growth in non-Mining regional areas has
remained positive over the past 15 years. In over two-thirds of these non-Mining regional
areas, growth in the number of people employed in non-market industries such as Health
Care, Education and Public Administration has outstripped growth in the number of people
in all other industries. Since the end of the investment phase of the mining boom, growth in
Mining regions has been negative. This is a result of many factors including the downturn
in the commodity price cycle.

In 2000–01, 40 SA4s had an estimated GRP per capita below 75 per cent of
Australia’s GDP per capita ($55,810). This has remained consistent over the past
15 years. In 2015–16, 44 SA4s had an estimated GRP per capita below 75 per cent
of the national average ($69,421). Table 3.3 shows this in more detail.
The information in Table 3.3 is based on each SA4’s GRP per capita as a share
of national GDP per capita — relative GRP per capita. For the years 2000–01 and
2015–16, SA4s were assigned to ranges based on their relative GRP per capita
— an SA4 with a relative GRP per capita of 69 per cent would be assigned to the
50–70 per cent range.
The first column n gives the number of SA4s that were in each range in 2000–01.
The second column lists the ranges SA4s were assigned to — in 2000–01 there
were three SA4s with a relative GRP per capita of 50 per cent or less.
The top row of the table lists the relative GRP ranges for 2015–16. The main diagonal
of the table shows the share of SA4s that were in the same relative GRP per capita
range in 2000–01 and 2015–16.
Reading along the third row of the table, in 2000–01 37 SA4s had a relative GRP
per capita between 50 and 75 per cent. In 2015–16, 76 per cent of these SA4s
remained in this range, 8 per cent fell to the 50 per cent or less range, 14 per cent
moved up to the 75–100 per cent range, and 3 per cent moved to between 100 and
125 per cent. SA4s that remained in the 50 and 75 per cent range included Coffs
Harbour — Grafton; Ballarat; Launceston; and North East Tasmania. The large share
that remained in the same range shows the persistent inequality in terms of GRP
per capita.
Examining Table 3.3, it is evident that SA4s below the national average — relative
GRP per capita below 100 per cent — remain below, and those above the average
stay there. Typically, those regions that have gone down a range between 2000–01
and 2015–16 have been SA4s in outer capital city areas, for example Moreton Bay
— South in outer Brisbane.

15

SA4s with a relative GRP per capita of 100 per cent or more, in either 2000–01
or 2015–16, tended to be those in the inner capital city areas or Mining regions.
Mackay-Isaac-Whitsunday, an area of the Bowen Basin, transitioned from the 100 to
125 per cent range to the greater than 125 per cent range.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 120

The increasing concentration of Australia’s productive activity is — at least in part —
the product of agglomeration economies that result from co-location. Benefits of greater
concentration can take the form of deeper labour markets, increased access to specialised
suppliers (inputs and services), economies of scale and knowledge spill overs.100
The Productivity Commission conducted a study into the transition of regions post-mining
boom. As part of this study, an index of relative adaptive capacity was developed. The
Productivity Commission found the following factors to influence the capacity of regions to
be resilient:
g

Skills and education of regional workforces

g

Access to infrastructure and services

g

Availability of natural resources

g

Availability of financial resources to businesses and individuals

g

Industry diversity. 101

The spatial distribution of economic growth

Drivers of economic activity to capital
cities

According to this index, most major cities have a relatively higher adaptive capacity than
most remote and outer regional areas. This has implications for how regions perform and
can transition following changes in Australia’s economy and industry structure. These
results also have implications for the shifting of economic activity to capital cities.
The remainder of this section discusses some of the key drivers of economic concentration
as identified in the literature. The GRP estimates are considered in light of each driver
to better understand the trade-off and why the concentration of economic activity has
benefited some SA4s more than others.

areas are relatively better off and which areas grow relatively faster or slower.

Attracting talent and skills
Figure 3.4 shows total net internal migration for the working age cohort (15–64 years) over
the past 10 years. From the map it is evident that the working age cohort is migrating to areas
around CBDs or to major regional centres along the east coast. Economic concentration
helps to deepen labour markets and provides greater education opportunities — which in
turn results in greater migration to these areas.
Remote and regional areas of Australia have experienced a net loss of working age
residents. This is because areas with higher concentrations of economic activity are
attractive to people. In cities, job-search costs are lower, matches are better and wages
typically higher as a result of the greater productivity of firms from the spill overs associated
with concentration.102 Although not shown, immigrants also favour cities due to greater job
opportunities and existing cultural networks.
The flows of international migrants exacerbate these trends. The population flows of large
capital cities in Australia is like an hour glass. International migrants are poured in the top
at a slightly faster rate than older residents leave.103 The skilled migrant stream is heavily
concentrated in the CBDs of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.

this is not always the case. There are some regions that have experienced high economic

Trade enables growth and job creation
Trade provides new market opportunities for domestic firms, stronger productivity and
innovation through competition.104 In understanding the dynamics and trajectory of
Australian regions, it is important not to view them in isolation but to explore the role they
play in the national and international trading networks.
To be a gateway to the international economy, a region needs three characteristics: a
sea port; an international airport; and most importantly a CBD that hosts a critical mass
of advanced producer services like finance, marketing and management consulting to
facilitate and contribute to the products being traded. In Australia, there are only two cities
that have such critical mass — Sydney and Melbourne. Around 90 per cent of publically
traded firms by value are located in Sydney and Melbourne, and around three quarters of
international business travel passes through their airports.105
Figure 3.6 shows the collective growth rates for areas with or without a sea port or an
international airport. It is evident SA4s with either a sea port or international airport tend to
grow faster. Trade openness encourages the concentration of economic activity because
firms will choose to locate in certain regions in order to gain access to international markets
and benefit from trade.
Australia’s geographic isolation and its relatively fragmented domestic markets contribute
to relatively higher transport and infrastructure costs, and limit Australia’s exposure to
domestic and international trade.

While technologies such as the National Broadband Network and video conferencing enable
people to work remotely — away from cities — the more fundamental force of technological
change is shifting the Australian economy into knowledge-intensive industries that thrive in
the centres of large cities.
The shifting industry structure of the Australian economy is driving the concentration of
economic activity to capital cities. The economy has been transitioning away from goodsproducing industries to more high-value, knowledge-intensive industries.106
Compared to goods-producing industries, which are reliant on immobile factors of production,
such as land, knowledge-intensive industries rely on mobile factors of production like human
capital. This geographic dimension of production means knowledge-intensive industries,
such as finance, are less likely to locate in regional Australia because they typically benefit
from knowledge spillovers, deeper labour markets and economies of scale.107
Areas outside of capital cities tend to produce relatively low levels of economic activity,
despite being home to a significant share of the population. The production that takes
place in these areas typically involves population-serving industries.108 Over the past 15
years these population-serving industries — the non-market services sector — have been
the main source of employment growth in non-Mining regional areas. Examples of nonmarket services are Health Care and Education, where the public sector plays a significant
role. These industries accounted for around 53 per cent of total employment growth in
non-Mining regional Australia, resulting in an additional 361,000 employed persons.

Knowledge-intensive industries

Knowledge-intensive industries — typically industries in the market services sector —
are key drivers of productivity and economic growth.109 Figure 3.7 shows that SA4s with
higher GRP growth tend to be those with greater growth in market services employment
— typically in greater capital city areas.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 120

Since 2000–01, Australia’s economic growth has largely been strongest in capital cities —
Mining regions are the exception to this. Individually, some regions are not as well off as the
average and as cities continue to grow, regions are likely to fall further behind as a share of
the economy (i.e. inequality between regions and cities is likely to grow).
The concentration of economic activity in cities is occurring from a natural incentive for
people and firms to be close to each other — there are big benefits to agglomeration.
These benefits take the form of deeper labour and consumer markets, increased access to
specialised suppliers (inputs and services), economies of scale, knowledge spill-overs and
lower transportation costs.
Technological change is shifting the Australian economy into knowledge-intensive
industries that thrive in the centre of large cities. Knowledge-intensive industries rely on
human capital as the primary factor of production. This means they are less likely to locate
in regional Australia because they typically benefit more from critical mass of human capital
and agglomeration. The overall shift of knowledge-intensive industries into the centre of
large cities is occurring despite technology improvements that also enable people to work
remotely.

The spatial distribution of economic growth

Regions of the future

Trade provides new market opportunities for domestic firms, stronger productivity and
innovation through competition. Trade openness encourages economic activity to
concentrate in certain regions to gain access to international markets and benefit from
trade.
The concentration of economic activity in capital cities makes it difficult to predict long-term
sources of growth in regional areas. However, implications of this concentration may be
larger for cities themselves rather than regional areas. Rapidly growing cities put pressure
on infrastructure and investment may not keep up. With the economic centre of gravity
shifting to CBDs, transporting more people from outer areas to jobs in the centre of cities
will be challenging. Long commute times have implications for labour force participation
and health. In part, the future economic success of Australia will depend on having cities
that function well and can adjust to growing demands.

Budget Policy and Institutions Program Director, Grattan Institute
Geography is destiny, or so we are often told. In which case, what do geographic trends in
population and economic activity tell us about Australia’s future policy challenges?
Australia is highly urbanised, and becoming more so. The most densely populated parts
of the country house 80 per cent of the population but occupy less than one per cent of
the land mass. And population has grown faster in our cities than elsewhere over the past
decade. The Pilbara mining region and the major regional centres, such as Bendigo in
Victoria and Wollongong in New South Wales, have also increased their populations, but
the populations of much of the rest of regional Australia are either stagnant or declining.
These regional differences in population growth reflect longer-term structural changes in
the Australian economy.
As in other developed economies, an increasing proportion of the Australian workforce
is employed in service industries. Over 50 years, employment in Services has risen
from five in ten workers to eight in ten workers. Service jobs, particularly professional
services, tend to cluster in cities and their centres. This is because there are big benefits
to ‘agglomeration’, being close to lots of other service firms.110 These Services jobs attract
people both from overseas and within Australia who are younger and more educated than
the general population. So it is not surprising that cities have a higher proportion of young
people, immigrants, and people with a tertiary education than regional areas.111

In contrast, the loss of agricultural and manufacturing work is felt most keenly in regional
and outer-suburban areas. Populations in these areas tend to be older and have a higher
proportion of the population born in Australia.
But it’s not all bad news for the regions. Analysis of tax return data by postcode shows that
while incomes are on average higher in the cities, income growth per person has been
similar in the regions and the cities over the past decade. And nor is unemployment notably
worse in the regions.112

Governments should not fight the ‘gravitational’ pull of the cities and major regional centres.
Past attempts at intervention have been expensive and did little to increase regional
growth and productivity.113 Governments are better off focusing on building and maintaining
transport infrastructure links (but only where the benefits outweigh the costs) and improving
the quality of services in regional areas.
Governments should also do more to ensure our cities remain resilient and productive.
The disconnect in Australia’s major cities between where the people are and where the jobs
are is a major policy problem. Most city jobs have been added within 10 km of the central
business districts (CBDs). But, other than high-rise apartments in the centre, almost all the
population growth has been added 20 km or more from the city centres, with housing estates
being built on what was farmland.114 There has been some medium-density development in
middle-ring suburbs but not enough to keep up with population growth.115 Australia’s large
cities remain particularly sparsely populated compared with cities of similar size.

The lack of new homes being built in desirable areas near high-paying jobs has contributed
to strong increases in house prices in our cities. And limiting housing near high-paying
productive jobs reduces economic growth.116
Governments should reform planning and zoning regulations to increase density in the
middle-ring suburbs of our cities. The focus should be medium-density development:
townhouses and terrace houses, which is what people say they want.117
Governments should also act to limit growing road congestion in our major cities. In Sydney
and Melbourne, some car trips into the CBD take twice as long during the morning and
afternoon peaks as in the middle of the night. And the problem is getting worse as the
population grows.118 Congestion charges in the most congested areas of each city during
peak periods would help improve travel times and spread traffic across the day.
Ultimately, policymakers must work with, not against, the forces shifting Australia’s
economic geography. Governments can’t push economic water uphill, but they can smooth
the transition by ensuring that regional areas have access to good-quality services and that
our cities are flexible enough to cope with growing numbers of people and activity.
