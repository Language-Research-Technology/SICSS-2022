Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 123

Executive Summary
Regional inequality exists across many geographic scales. This submission compares
regions at several different scales to emphasise the range of different types of inequality
experienced across Australia. Differences in socio-economic disadvantage are used to
highlight how inequality can occur between regions, but also within regions.
Throughout this submission the level and distribution of income is used as the simplest and
most well-accepted measure of inequality and disadvantage. These measures reveal that
regional areas tend to have lower median incomes and higher numbers of low income
residents compared to Australia’s largest cities. However, there are also locations within
cities with low median incomes and a large share of low income residents.
In order to address regional inequalities the Australian Government supports people
experiencing disadvantage in the regions and across Australia, through the social welfare
safety net and the provision of high-quality services. The Australian Government is also
committed to driving jobs, economic growth and opportunity across Australia.
The range of programs managed by the Department of Infrastructure, Regional
Development and Cities is presented in this submission to demonstrate how the Australian
Government is addressing inequality between the regions. The Department leads the
Australian Government’s regional development agenda including infrastructure and transport
investment, policies and programs to better connect regions, and support for local
governments to provide the services people expect. These programs are underpinned by
accurate and reliable information that assists Government to identify opportunities and
challenges in our regions.
The Department also leads a range of policies and programs that target outcomes in specific
geographic places through investments and cooperative arrangements with other levels of
government, business and communities. This submission presents the examples of City
Deals; providing services to the Indian Ocean territories, and Norfolk Island and Jervis Bay;
and supporting regions undergoing economic transition.

Indicators of Inequality and Disadvantage
Inequality exists across many geographic scales. This submission compares regions at
several different scales to highlight the range of different types of inequality. In some cases,
comparisons are made between Regional Australia and the Major Cities of Australia, based
on the ABS remoteness classification.1 In other cases, this submission compares Australia’s
largest cities (population greater than 2,000,000); with its medium-sized cities (population
80,000-2,000,000); and with the rest of Australia. These geographic comparisons reflect the
different measures of regional inequality.
There is a range of available measures of inequality. 2 Socio-economic disadvantage varies
based on people’s access to material and social resources, and their ability to participate in
society.3 The ABS’s Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) calculates socio-economic
disadvantage using a range of indicators including economic resources, human capital, and
access to transport and infrastructure of households in a region. The regions of Australia are
characterised by variation in socio-economic disadvantage. Map 1 shows the ranking of
areas in terms of their relative socio-economic disadvantage.

Progress in Australian Regions Yearbook
The Department also publishes the Progress in Australian Regions Yearbook (the
Yearbook), an annual resource that measures progress in a region against social, economic,
environmental and governance indicators.
Overall, the 2017 Yearbook illustrates that Australia’s performance across social, economic,
environmental and governance measures is mixed, with some indicators demonstrating
positive growth and others deteriorating over the same period. Key trends include:





a reduction in household income inequality across most regions in Australia –
increases in income inequality were mostly observed in remote areas of the Northern
Territory;
a decline in some labour market measures and housing indicators such as home
ownership; and
an improvement in life expectancy across most cities and sub-state areas.

This publication can be used to assess inequality between and within regions across a range
of indicators. This publication can be accessed on the Department’s website:
www.infrastructure.gov.au/regional-yearbook.

Inequality in Income, Cost of Living and Amenity Across Australia
As indicated, this submission focuses on the level and distribution of income as the simplest
and most well-accepted measures of inequality and disadvantage. These reveal that
regional areas tend to have lower median incomes and higher numbers of low income
residents.5
The median household income in the big four cities is around 40 per cent higher than the
median household income in locations with populations smaller than 80,000. Further, the
share of low income households in the smaller locations is around 40 per cent higher than
the big four cities. However, it should be noted there is significant variance in the extent of
disadvantage across Australia and there are pockets of disadvantage in cities as well as
regions.
Interpreting these results is not straightforward as some of this difference reflects the older
age profile of regional locations as well as differences in the education and skill levels of
residents. When comparing the median incomes of prime age residents, the income gap
narrows to around 15 per cent between the big four cities and areas with populations smaller
than 80,000. However, even this figure may overstate differences in quality of life since it
does not account for the generally lower cost of housing in the regions. Other factors not
considered include amenity, access to services and broader cost of living measures which
differ between cities and regions.

For the purposes of this submission we have adopted the ABS’s approach of defining low-income households as those in the bottom income
quintile

Median household incomes are higher in Australia’s largest cities (population greater than 2,000,000)
than in its medium-sized cities (population 80,000-2,000,000) and areas in the rest of Australia
(Chart 2). In proportional terms, the differences in income levels between these areas have been
relatively constant since 2001 (Chart 3).

Regional areas have a higher proportion of low-income households than cities (Chart 4). However, these broad
aggregations do not reflect the significant variance in disadvantage across regions (see Map 1), or the extent of
income inequality within regions. That is, large cities, medium sized cities and regional areas all contain places that
have high and low proportions of low-income households (see examples in Chart 5).

A range of factors contribute to lower income levels in regional areas, and policy interventions are not appropriate
for many of these factors. For example, a higher proportion of retirement age residents live in regions and income
levels decline significantly once people reach retirement age (Charts 6 and 7). Although, the relationship of wealth
to age is different than that of income to age due to the accumulation of wealth over a person’s lifetime.

Higher income levels in larger cities may to some extent be offset by higher housing costs (Charts 8 and 9). That
said, other elements of cost of living can be higher for people living in the regions 6 and access to services can be
poorer. Cost of living and access to services issues are particularly acute for people living in smaller, more remote
areas without good access to transport.

The comparative quality of life that people experience in different areas is also affected by differences in amenity.
For example, the quality of life for people in larger cities is adversely affected by longer commuting time and people
in regional areas can have better access to natural assets such as lakes, beaches and nature reserves.7

Australian Government Role in Addressing
Disadvantage and Promoting Economic Growth
The Australian Government’s social welfare safety net plays a critical role in supporting
people experiencing disadvantage across Australia. At the national level, provision of
transport and community infrastructure; and delivery of higher education and health care
have spatial implications and impact on regional access to economic opportunities. All
portfolios and levels of government also have a role in creating equitable access to
economic and social opportunities.
The Australian Government is focused on economic growth so all Australians have the
opportunity to contribute to their full potential. The Government’s Economic Plan, as set out
in the 2018-19 Budget Overview, aims to foster economic growth in order to create jobs,
strengthen the budget and enable the Government to provide essential services. The
Economic Plan also aims to support regional Australia and ensure the benefits of economic
growth are spread across the nation.
National economic growth is particularly important for regions experiencing disadvantage
and economic weakness. Weaker regions tend to benefit disproportionately from national
economic growth. This can be seen in the unemployment rate, with areas of high
unemployment experiencing the biggest improvements during periods of strong national
economic growth. For example, over the ten year period from October 1998 the national
unemployment rate fell from 7.3 per cent to 4.3 per cent8 and there was convergence in the
unemployment rate between regions with high, medium and low unemployment rates
(Chart 10).9

Infrastructure Investment, Regional Development
and Place-Based Initiatives
The Australian Government is committed to driving jobs, economic growth and opportunity in
the regions. In this context, the Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities portfolio is
responsible for:


the design and implementation of the Australian Government’s regional development
agenda including infrastructure and transport investment, policies and programs to
better connect regions and support for local governments to provide the services
people expect, and



a range of policies and programs that target outcomes in specific geographic places
through investments and cooperative arrangements with other levels of government,
business and communities, such as City Deals; providing services to the
Indian Ocean territories, Norfolk Island and Jervis Bay; and supporting regions
undergoing economic transition.

These place-based policies promote economic opportunities, target disadvantage and
improve access to services in a range of areas across Australia.
Australian Government place-based policies or programs are particularly beneficial where
they:


unlock underlying economic potential or value to enhance national prosperity, as
well as benefitting specific areas;



align with national policy goals and priorities; and



engage willing and capable partners in local communities, business and different
levels of government in their design and delivery.

Infrastructure Investment
The Australian Government has committed to a decade long $75 billion Infrastructure
Investment Pipeline for new and upgraded transport infrastructure projects, with the aim of
increasing productivity, boosting local communities, connecting our regions and cities, and
creating local jobs.
There are many benefits for regions from the Government’s investment in land transport
infrastructure including:

9



construction of land transport projects which support job creation and economic
development, including in regional Australia;



improving connectivity across our regions providing better access to employment,
health, education and training opportunities; and



improving road safety, particularly for long distance travel between key regional
centres and local communities.

Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities Submission

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 123

Through the infrastructure Pipeline, the Australian Government has made major
commitments to deliver a range of road and rail infrastructure projects which support the
Government’s Infrastructure Investment Program (IIP). The IIP provides significant grant
funding to the states and local governments to deliver road, rail, bridges and heavy vehicle
projects.
The role of infrastructure investment in connecting communities is evident through the
Australian Government’s investments in the Northern Territory. For example, through the
2018-19 Budget, the Australian Government has committed up to $180 million towards the
Central Arnhem Road Upgrade. The upgrade will include sealing, reconstruction, widening,
and flood immunity improvements to priority sections of the route to a fit-for-purpose
standard.
The project will support inter-regional connections to and from Nhulunbuy and Katherine,
and will improve community access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities
all year round. In addition, the project will support the growth of rural populations and the
agricultural and tourism industries through improved route reliability.
The new $3.5 billion Roads of Strategic Importance (ROSI) initiative will fund upgrades to
our key regional freight routes to improve access for higher productivity vehicles and to
regional communities. ROSI will open up corridors to provide a more reliable road network,
improve access for higher capacity vehicles, better connect regional communities, and
facilitate tourism opportunities. Improved access provided through ROSI will deliver
substantial social and economic benefits, including opportunities for greater regional
employment and business growth.
In addition to delivering major individual projects, the IIP includes a number of sub-programs
that target minor, but high benefit works, often on local roads and inter-regional corridors.
These include the Roads to Recovery Program, the Bridges Renewal Program, the Heavy
Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, and the Black Spot Program.

Regional Development Programs
The Australian Government acknowledges the challenges faced in regional communities and
is committed to creating jobs, driving economic growth and building stronger regional
communities. The Government’s regional grants programs assist regions to remain
sustainable, by building communities that people want to live in, and return for work,
business and lifestyle opportunities.
The Government is investing in programs to ensure regional Australians have the same level
of economic opportunities and access to services compared to their urban counterparts.
The $272.2 million Regional Growth Fund (RGF) provides grants of $10 million or more
towards regional infrastructure projects that will unlock economic opportunities across the
regions. These projects will support long-term economic growth and create jobs in regions,
including those undergoing structural adjustment.
Other regional programs include


10

the $222.3 million Regional Jobs and Investment Packages (RJIP); and

Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities Submission

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 123



the $641.6 million Building Better Regions Fund (BBRF).

In the design of these regional programs, the Australian Government acknowledges there
are a number of hurdles potential applicants might face that could limit their ability to be
competitive in the grant assessment process. To address these issues:





program guidelines for some regional programs allow applicants to demonstrate that
they are experiencing exceptional circumstances and seek an exemption from the
co-funding requirement;
projects classified as remote or very remote can contribute less co-funding in
recognition of the challenges in remote communities; and
projects of similar size are compared against each by grouping applications in
categories based on total eligible project cost to ensure like projects are compared
with like.

Regional programs administered through the Department help address regional inequalities
by diversifying their economies, driving long-term growth and deliver sustainable
employment. The BBRF has been designed to achieve the following outcomes in regional
and remote communities:






create jobs;
have a positive impact on economic activity, including Indigenous economic
participation through employment and supplier-use outcomes;
enhance community facilities;
enhance leadership capacity; and
encourage community cohesion and sense of identity.

Funding Municipal Services Across Australia’s Regions
Access to services for regional areas is a key priority for the Australian Government. The
Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities portfolio provides essential funding to local
government organisations through the Financial Assistance Grants Program in order to
deliver municipal services to communities.
This program addresses differences in the ability of local governments to provide essential
services to their communities. Local Government Grants Commissions in each state and the
Northern Territory allocate funding to local councils in accordance with the Local
Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 and its National Principles. The funding is
untied and comprises two components; a general purpose component and a local road
component.
The general purpose component is allocated to local governing bodies on a full horizontal
equalisation basis as defined by the Act. It ensures that each local governing body in the
State/Territory is able to function at a standard not lower than the average standard of other
local governing bodies in the State. It takes account of differences in the expenditure
required by those local governing bodies in the performance of their functions and in the
capacity of those local governing bodies to raise revenue.

Decentralisation
The Decentralisation Agenda forms part of the Australian Government’s commitment to
promote economic activity in Australia’s regions and ensure every part of Australia benefits
from our growing economy. Decentralisation of government jobs, in the long term, can help
improve government service delivery through closer proximity to citizens and stakeholders,
and has the potential to provide long-term operational cost savings.
Decentralisation of government jobs outside of Canberra, central Sydney and Melbourne will
benefit regional communities through the creation of local jobs, local economic
diversification, and stimulation of regional economic growth in the long term.
The relocation of entities and positions will aim to provide new growth opportunities for the
nominated region and surrounding area, through:






improved service delivery including enhancing linkages with key stakeholders and
clients thereby improving service access in regional areas;
creating local jobs;
stimulating economic growth in receiving regions;
reducing socio-economic disparity between major cities and regional areas; and
increasing employment opportunities, by creating diversified and expanded career
pathways for regional Australians.

Place-Based Programs
City Deals
A City Deal is part of a new approach to urban policy internationally, which views cities as
critical economic assets with great potential. City Deals are place-based policies designed to
unlock the economic opportunities of a city, targeting issues of disadvantage and improving
access to services. The City Deals concept has also been applied internationally, particularly
in the United Kingdom. For example, the Greater Manchester City Deal completed in 2012
included a local transport infrastructure fund and transport expansion and improvement
program.10
A City Deal involves the three levels of government founded on unlocking economic
potential in a city. Governments need to work together to customise their approach to the
unique opportunities of the city, drawing on innovative financing and funding arrangements
to provide transformative investment. Institutional reforms and investments may also be
needed to create the whole-of-city capacity and governance arrangements necessary to
sustain and build on the improvements under the City Deal.

The Government aims to deliver City Deals in cities across Australia over the coming years.
The Government has committed to negotiating City Deals for all state and territory capital
cities, where partner governments are willing. Three City Deals have been signed to date:
Townsville, Launceston and Western Sydney. The Townsville City Deal is delivering a
development corporation, urban renewal and the North Queensland Stadium. The
Launceston Deal is relocating the University of Tasmania campus closer to the city centre.
The Western Sydney Deal is establishing rail and the Aerotropolis around the upcoming
Western Sydney Airport. Hobart, Geelong, Darwin and Perth all have City Deal negotiations
underway, with the three levels of government working to produce bespoke deals for each
city.
The other elements of the Government’s Smart Cities Agenda are:



National Cities Performance Framework - The National Cities Performance
Framework is the first official framework of its kind in Australia. It contains 16
contextual indicators and 30 performance indicators for Australia’s 21 largest cities
plus Western Sydney. These include traditional economic and social indicators—
such as the unemployment rate, homelessness rate and life expectancy—as well as
indicators that shed light on the specific challenges associated with living in major
cities – such as peak travel delay due to traffic congestion and access to green
space. The Performance Framework will support the continual improvement of our
cities by providing data to help all levels of government, industry and the community
make the best policy and investment decisions for Australia’s future. The
Performance Framework data is available in an easily accessible online format.11



Smart Cities and Suburbs Program and Future Ready – Smart Cities and
Suburbs is a competitive grants program that is delivering public and private sector
co-investment and collaboration in smart technology projects that improve the
liveability, productivity and sustainability of Australian cities, suburbs and towns.
Grants will fund up to 50 per cent of project costs, supporting small to large scale
initiatives delivered in metropolitan and regional urban centres. On 17 November
2017, it was announced that there were 49 successful projects in Round One of the
Program which will benefit from $27.7 million in Australian Government funding.
Around 40 per cent of these projects are in regional areas. Round 2 of the Program
was announced on 2 May 2018 and there will be around $22 million of funding
available. The Future Ready incubation package was developed to complement the
program, and it has been designed to help local government leaders and their
communities prepare for smart city transformations through co-learning and
collaboration with the public, private and civil sectors.

Services to Territories
The Australian Government’s Services to Territories program aims to maintain and improve
the quality of state-type services provided to residents of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island,
the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and the Jervis Bay Territory. It provides targeted support to the
ACT and NT through economic and social sustainability initiatives, while managing the
Australian Government’s interests.
This program seeks to deliver services to these remote communities that are comparable to
services available to similar communities on the mainland. Australia’s external territories are
some of the most remote and vulnerable communities in Australia. The program is directly
targeted at providing appropriate state-type services to these communities.
After 36 years of limited self-government, the Australian Government returned Norfolk Island
to a non-self-governing territory in 2015. This change in governance will enable the
Government to provide services and benefits previously unavailable to Norfolk Island
residents.
As of September 2017, Norfolk Island residents can now access Commonwealth support
payments and services, Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme, and family
relationship services. Moreover, the Government has provided significant funding to
redevelop the island’s health, education and maritime infrastructure. There have also been
improvements to support services that assist Norfolk Island residents travelling to mainland
Australia to access medical services.
As a result of these Government reforms, Norfolk Islanders now have enhanced access to
essential services. The Department’s evaluation shows that, overall, the Government’s
investment in Norfolk Island has had a significant impact including improvements to their
health and social system. Access to Medicare has resulted in increases in visits to doctors
and allied health practitioners. Additionally, over 400 residents now access Commonwealth
support payments and services.

Dealing with Economic Transition in Regional Australia
For some time the Australian Government has provided assistance to regions experiencing
difficulty adjusting to structural change, frequently as a result of firm closure or the decline of
a major industry. Structural changes can often lead to increasing disadvantage, as workers
become displaced from the labour market which limits their access to economic and social
opportunities.
Assistance for regions undergoing structural change has generally comprised an innovation
and investment fund and a package of job support measures to assist displaced workers in
the region. The current phase of structural change and the increased focus on regional
Australia provides the opportunity to redefine the Government’s approach to dealing with
structural change and reassess the effectiveness of regional assistance measures.
Throughout the 1990s, the Newcastle and the Hunter region have received substantial
Commonwealth and State Government assistance to support it through economic transition.
The Australian Government implemented structural adjustment initiatives that include
general social safety net measures, job search assistance, education and training initiatives

14

Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities Submission

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 123

and business advisory services. These initiatives provided support to displaced workers and
impacted small businesses.
The $10 million Newcastle Structural Adjustment Fund was also implemented to support
economic diversification by providing funding for regional development projects that
leveraged existing or emerging strengths outside the manufacturing sector. Projects funded
include updates to Newcastle Airport and Newcastle Harbour Marina.
The measures implemented by the Australian Government played an important role in
supporting displaced workers. Adjustment costs would have been substantially higher
without various forms of targeted assistance. The structural adjustment initiatives were
successful in leveraging emerging and existing strengths in the region including the tourism
sector.
Investments in the education, defence and health sectors have supported the development
of larger employers in the region including the University of Newcastle, the RAAF Base,
Hunter TAFE and the John Hunter Hospital. While these expansions were about service
