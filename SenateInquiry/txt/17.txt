Executive Summary
Regional inequality is generally taken to refer to spatially distributed disparities in spending
capacity, ability to consume non-public services, access to public services, and ability to
consume natural resources. Despite being a topical matter in the international literature
there is a dearth of analysis in an Australian context. We outline a number of metrics that can
provide us with a sense of how grave the inequality situation in Australia has become.
Following this we analyse the sources of inequality with a particular emphasis on
government policy and institutions. This leads us to propose a number of innovative policy
changes that could address the problem, given sufficient political will. In particular, we call
for the introduction of equality statements for all major policy and institutional changes, to
provide a counterweight to the business case methodologies that currently inform most
political decision-making.
There is a long history of scholarship on the matter of inequality. Most of the emphasis has
previously been placed on inequality at the level of nation states, although recently prominent
scholars have started to pay greater attention to inequality, at the regional level, that falls
within nation states (Wei, 2015; Sellers et al., 2017; Stiglitz, 2013). One explanation for the
recent surge in interest, with respect to regional inequality, stems from the perception that
inequality was exacerbated as a result of government responses to the Global Financial Crisis
(and there is certainly a good deal of evidence, from abroad, to suggest that this was indeed
the case for income and wealth equality). Another explanation seems to be that interest has

increased in response to high-profile evidence of social unrest precipitated in large part as a
result of inequality (for instance the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring;
Stiglitz, 2013). However, in contrast to increasing levels of attention by scholars abroad,
there is a veritable dearth of analysis in the context of Australia. This is despite the fact that
there is some extant evidence of relatively high levels of both income inequality and wealth
inequality (ABS, 2018 – see below).
Regional inequality is generally taken to refer to spatially distributed capacities to consume
public and market goods, natural resources, and spending capacity (Sellers et al., 2017). Most
of the existing body of literature focusses on economic measures of inequality – particularly
inequality of incomes, or at a national level, inequality of gross domestic product. These
measures provide us with some sense of equality of outcomes (although some would assert
that equality of outcomes need to be measured over lifetimes, rather than at particular discrete
moments in time), which are largely contingent on equality of opportunity (there is some
reason to suppose that inequality of outcomes is mostly a symptom of inequality of
opportunity; Stiglitz, 2013). Indeed, it is probably best to mostly focus on inequality of
income as an indicator of inequality of opportunity given that it is not entirely clear that the
former is either possible or desirable (as an end in itself) in a capitalist society. Arguably
there should be different outcomes to reward effort, risk, and skills – to remove these
variations in outcomes would be unjust (in a Natural Law sense; Messner, 1952) and would
probably destroy the incentives that make most modern economies work. Instead, what would
seem most important is to ensure equality of opportunity (certainly as a justice measure, in a
Natural Law sense, but also for the efficient operation of the national economy) and this will
be our primary focus.
It is important to note that some dimensions of spatial equality exist prior to government, that
other dimensions are amenable to mitigation through public policy, whilst yet others are the
result of public policy. Take, for instance, the ability to consume natural resources. Initial
resource endowments – such as fresh water – are largely given to us as a relatively fixed
feature of geography; however lack of water can be mitigated by public spending (by
building dams and other water infrastructure) or can be exacerbated as a consequence of
restricting access to natural endowments (for example, the Murray-Darling water
management scheme). In this regard, the term coined by Sellers et al. (2017, p. 9) – ‘regimes
of place equality’ – is particularly useful as it draws attention to how ‘policies, governance
strategies and institutions…either contribute to disparities in taxes, spending capacities and
public services across...regions or mitigate or compensates for those disparities’. At the heart
of their thesis is the assertion that inequality is not some sort of accident, but is largely the
result of policies and institutions acting over long periods of time (see also, North, 1991).
Otherwise stated ‘government sets and enforces the rules of the game…gives away
resources…and through taxes and social expenditure, modifies the distribution of
income…[and] alters the dynamics of wealth’ (Stiglitz, 2013, p. 38). Our focus will be on
explicating how policies and institutions, mediated through political interactions, impact on
equality in Australia.

Generally research, both in Australia and abroad, has been focussed on inequality between
urban regions – particularly with respect to the urban fringe – because this is where most
people reside (see, Sellers et al. 2017). Moreover, political interest has also focussed mainly
on the urban fringe ‘as outer electorate suburbs make or break governments’ (Beer, 1994, p.
183). However, there is greater inequality in rural and regional areas in Australia. For
instance, where the lead author resides on the North-Western slopes of NSW, most properties
do not have access to running water, sewer service, or sealed roads. In addition access to
basic services such as education, law enforcement, mail services, and health requires one to
travel considerable distances. (indeed, one could be mistaken for thinking that the author
lives in a third world country, rather than the electorate of the former Deputy Prime
Minister), which isn’t the case for even the most deprived urban fringe resident (although
there waiting times or service standards may be deemed to be less than satisfactory). To
address this neglect in the literature we have taken a broad view of regional equality that
specifically considers rural and remote areas.
This paper seeks to cast light on inequality in Australia and propose innovative and
efficacious solutions to the problem. In the next section we review some measures of income
and wealth inequality which, as we note, are good indicators of broader inequality of
opportunity. Thereafter, we detail some of the reasons why inequality matters. Following this
we review, in greater detail, the source of inequality. We conclude by detailing some
efficacious and innovative public policy interventions which might be expected to arrest and
reduce levels of inequality in Australia.

Indicators of Inequality
The most robust and accessible indicators of inequality are those pertaining to income and
wealth. As noted in the introduction these indicators do not directly relate to equality of
outcomes, although there is good reason to suspect that equality of opportunity is positively
and strongly associated with equality of outcomes (Stiglitz, 2013). This is because income
and wealth are tied closely to political power which is the medium through which many
institutions, and hence opportunities, are distributed (Acemoglou et al. 2002).
Table 1 presents the Gini coefficients for twenty-six OECD nations in 2015 (all nations for
which data was available in 2015 are included). The Gini coefficient is the area between a
line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve (which measures the cumulative fraction of the
indicator being measured after first arraying households from lowest to highest). Essentially,
the Gini coefficient operates on a scale from 0 (perfect equality) through to 1 (perfect
inequality). Otherwise stated if X% of households received X% of the income throughout the
distribution, then the Gini coefficient would be 0 – however, if all the income went to the top
household then the Gini coefficient would be 1. According to Stiglitz (2013, p. 28) ‘more
equal societies have Gini coefficients of .3 or below’. By this criteria Australia is not an
‘equal society’ which probably stands in stark contrast to most people’s perceptions of our
egalitarian nature. Moreover, when one looks at Table 1 it is clear that Australia generally
does have a much higher level of inequality than most of the Nordic and former communist
countries, in particular. There thus seems to be good grounds for asserting the need to
introduce public policy remedies with respect to the matter of inequality.

Income inequality, of course, is not constant over time and in Australia it seems that there is a
good deal of variation from year to year (see Figure 1). Unfortunately, due to a change in
methodology income inequality statistics for Australia can only be reliably compared from
2007-08 onwards (although it can be noted that all of the years for which reliable
comparative data is presented are above the 0.3 criteria for low inequality). However, it is
clear that there is no downward trend that might give comfort that inequality is reducing over
time (indeed there is no statistically significant trend at all). Similarly the P80/20 ratio (which
measures the ratio of households at the 80th percentile relative to households at the 20th
percentile – thus eliminating outliers and giving a better picture of where most Australian
households might sit) also shows a good deal of variation and no clear trend (see Figure 2.).

Another way of thinking about inequality is to examine the disparity in nett worth of
households over time. Here we are able to use a much longer panel of data and it is clear that
inequality in household wealth is at, what can only be described as, alarming levels (if we
consider data in terms of the commonly espoused rule of thumb that the most unequal
societies have Gini coefficients greater than 0.5; see Figure 3). This observation is brought
into stark relief by the P80/20 household nett worth, which illustrates a difference in worth of
over 12.3 times between the two specified percentiles. Indeed the P80/20 metric (which has
the important attribute of stripping out the outliers and thus giving a more reliable picture of
most people’s relative circumstances), suggests that the change in inequality has only
occurred in one direction over the period, that is, toward greater inequality.

It is also important to see if inequality is distributed evenly across the states and territories of
Australia. Table 2 presents the Median and Mean wage, P80/20 ratio, Gini coefficient, and
the proportion of income accrued by the top 1% and 10% of households for income in the
eight states and territories of Australia. It is important to note that the Gini here excludes
Government pensions, allowances and other transfers and comparison to the earlier cited Gini
gives a sense of how such transfers mitigate some of the income inequality in the nation.
Table 2 suggests that households in the territories typically have higher incomes, and less
inequality which stands in contrast to their state peers. This demonstrates that inequality is
spatially distributed at the level of states and territories in Australia. Moreover, an
examination of the same data at a ‘capital city and rest’ statistical level suggests that
inequality is also distributed spatially within states. Table 3 presents data for each greater

capital city and the rest of the state or territory to provide us with a sense of how income
inequality manifests within these second tier governments. In each case typical wages are
significantly higher in the capital cities, than for the rest of the state; however, inequality is
mostly higher within ‘rest of state’ areas (especially when measured by the P80/20 ratio).
This picture of inequality within Tier 2 governments is broadly consistent with the Tieboutian
concept whereby persons are expected to sort themselves into more or less homogenous
groups as they seek to match the tastes to the price that they are willing to pay (Grant and
Drew, 2017). In Appendix A, we further disaggregate inequality data to the next regional
level and in most cases the pattern holds (with notable exceptions for some mining and
coastal regions).

In sum, relative to other nations Australia has modest levels of income inequality that would
probably be a good deal worse except for the provision of government transfers. Incomes are
typically higher in the ACT and capital cities, which are also the location for the bulk of
Australia’s institutions, political electorates, and public servants. As one moves out to the
geographical fringe incomes typically decrease, as does inequality (within the region) –
suggesting that there is a degree of sorting involved in household location decisions. Rural
areas typically have low incomes but mid-range levels of inequality that may be a
consequence of rural estate legacies. In terms of wealth inequality, Australia has a
disturbingly high Gini coefficient. Moreover the P80/20 ratio for nett household wealth
shows that the trend has been ever upwards and that the difference between the two
percentiles is a factor of over 12.3. As noted, robust and accessible statistics are not available
for other aspects of inequality (such as access to public goods, market goods and ability to
consume natural endowments). However, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the spatial
distribution of these dimensions will follow the spatial distribution of income and wealth
because opportunity is associated with spending capacity and political power (Acemglou et
al. 2002; Pike et al. 2007; Stiglitz, 2013) whilst economic theory predicts that house
valuations (a large part of Australian’s wealth) have imputed to them the standard and access
of public services and some natural endowments (Ladd, 1998; Grant and Drew, 2017).
Moreover, one should be mindful that access to many public goods and market goods on the
urban fringe is within tolerable commuting range (and often accessible through public
transport). Thus prima facie disparities between urban fringe and rural incomes, whilst being
a reliable indicator of spending capacity, may fail to adequately convey disparities with
respect to access to public goods (in particular) and market goods for these two groups.
We now examine, in greater detail why inequality matters in order to better explain the
importance of the indicators of inequality that we have detailed above.

Why does Inequality Matter?
There are strong economic justifications for preferring greater regional equality given that it
reduces inefficient migration of capital and labour (Oates, 1999) and migration of labour, in
particular, has implications for the cost of providing infrastructure (Beer, 1994), and other
costs associated with housing supply and affordability. In addition, regional equality is also
critical to the health of federations given that it is associated with reductions of wasteful
lobbying and less opportunities for pork barrelling (Drew and Campbell, 2016), binds the
federation together (Boadway and Shah, 2009) and reduces political conflict (Lecours and
Beland, 2013). However, as laudable as these economic and federalism rationales are for
regional equality, they fail to provide a persuasive moral justification for reducing regional
inequality. It is only when we consider both the desirability of achieving equality of
opportunity (which does have a ready moral justification in Natural Law 4) and the fact that
the infrastructure, natural resources and institutions required for same are spatially
distributed, that it becomes clear that a certain degree of equality at the regional level is
indirectly required for a just society. Otherwise stated, unless regions have largely similar
levels of equality in terms of infrastructure, access to institutions, and ability to consume
natural resources, then it is hard to see how any two similar persons living in two distinct
regions might be able to have similar equality of opportunity (notably equality of opportunity
will still depend on other factors (which we detail below), what we are simply asserting here
is that regional equality seems to be a pre-requisite for equality of opportunity – see Drew
and Dollery, 2015).
There are a number of other grounds for preferring lower levels of inequality between
households, in a nation. For example, there is evidence that domestic market consumption is
stronger where less inequality occurs, as are growth in small business (both of which arise
from clearer definition of more homogenous markets) and economic growth more generally
(although causality is an altogether more difficult matter to demonstrate; Biswas et al. 2017).
Moreover, because a lot of inequality is caused by rent-seeking (an unproductive activity in
which persons or businesses seek to receive surpluses that are greater than what might be
received in a competitive market) and political capitalisation (turning hard capital into votes;
Weingast et al. 1981; Drew and Dollery, 2017), inequality is economically inefficient (it also
represents a sub-optimal use of human and natural resources). Indeed, it has been
persuasively argued that inequality puts ‘democracy in peril’ (Stiglitz, 2013, p. 148) because
if people perceive that inequality is being exacerbated by unequal voice and power then they
will participate less in the political process, trust less in political leadership (and institutions
and the media who report on same) and be more inclined to participate in civil disobedience
(Stiglitz, 2013). The fact that only around 90 % of those who bother to register to vote
actually turned out for the 2016 Federal election for nominally compulsory voting, and that a

Specifically Natural Law provides a moral case for dignity (the inherent right of persons to pursue their
existential ends), whilst fostering the common good (the help accruing to persons through co-operation) (Drew
and Grant, 2017).

further 5% of those cast an informal vote, should be an alert to the likelihood that many
Australian’s are feeling (and becoming) politically disenfranchised 5 (see, Tables 4 and 5).

The effect of inequality on democracy is a vicious cycle – the more people feel unempowered the less they will trust and participate and hence the less they will be heard in the
future. A similar vicious cycle occurs with respect to equality of opportunity and equality of
outcomes. The less opportunity there is for moving up the inequality ladder, the less
likelihood there is that persons in a position of power will fully appreciate the level of
inequality that exists and hence the less likely it is that inequality will be addressed. This
cycle probably explains the inequality of outcomes data that we briefly surveyed earlier, as
well as the importance of addressing inequality of opportunity as soon as possible.

Another indication of political disenfranchisement is to make a survey of politicians from low socio-economic
backgrounds, politicians from the ranks of the voting-aged youth, politicians from various minority groups, and
compare this to the wider population.

Sources of Inequality
Inequality is principally the result of ‘long-term trajectories of policies and institutional
development’ (Sellers et al., 2017, p. 271; see also, Acemoglou et al. 2002; Pike et al. 2007;
Beer, 1994) and policies and institutions are arbitrated largely through the political process.
Therefore if there is inequality at a regional level we can probably trace much of its source
back to political inequality (Stiglitz, 2013; Acemoglou and Robinson, 2000).
There are three main sources of inequality in political power in the Australian federation.
First, because electoral boundaries are associated with population, and because population is
concentrated in greater capital cities, it follows that there are more political representatives
from greater capital cities in the two tiers of Australian parliaments, then there are from, for
instance, rural and remote areas (Parliament of Australia, 2018). Second, due to the
combination of geographically defined electoral boundaries and preferential voting systems
the proportion of the votes that a party attracts (which can be considered a reflection of
political preferences) is not reflected in the number of seats that the party receives in the
lower house. For instance, in the 2016 Federal election the Greens (nationally) received
around 10% of the vote, but received just 0.7% of the lower house seats; conversely the
Liberal party attracted approximately 29% of the vote and initially received almost 39% of
the seats (Australian Electoral Commission, 2016). When these two sources of inequality in
political power are considered together it suggests that the political preferences of the voters
who constitute regions are not being reflected in the make-up of the lower houses of
Parliaments 6. Third, all Australians do not have equal access to Ministers. Constituents who
live in the electorate of a Minister have greater access than those who do not; and a number
of recent high profile cases have shown us that political donors and lobbyists have greater
access to Ministers than regular constituents. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that
foreign powers have greater access to Ministers and shadow-Ministers than the regular
Australian constituent (ABC, 2017)! The point is that it may be one vote one value in
rhetoric, but it is impossible to argue that it is one vote one value in actual fact – specifically,
it is those at the top of the inequality ladder, who are likely to being wielding the greatest
power in Australia’s political system, just as it is the top 1% that have the political power
abroad (Stiglitz, 2013) 7.
Most of the spatial manifestations of inequality – access to natural resources, access to
infrastructure and institutions, access to non-public goods and services – have their origins, or
could be mitigated, through the political process. We now consider each one in turn in order
to provide a level of explication that is conducive to outlining specific and efficacious public
policy remedies in our concluding section (which follows).
As noted earlier, inequality can be seen in inequitable access to natural endowments (such as
water, minerals, clean air; see Sellers et al. 2017; Acemoglou et al. 2002). Not only are

This is not the case for the Upper House so much (although federally it is constrained by state/territory
geographic fragments), which probably explains the diversity of political parties in the Senate.

natural resources spatially distributed, but the problem of unequal access is further
compounded by policies that regulate the consumption of resources (for example, water
controls, logging controls, bans on coal seam gas (CSG) extractions). The irony of the
situation in Australia is that the political interests regulating the consumption of natural
resources generally hail from regions far removed from where the effects of the constraint
will bite. For instance, only one of the Green’s federal parliamentarians – who have a range
of party policies constraining use of natural resources – lists their political office outside of
Canberra or a Greater Capital City (Greens, 2018).
Another aspect of inequality is unequal access to public goods and services. For example,
infrastructure often varies by region and, as we have noted earlier, properties outside of towns
in rural and remote areas generally do not have access to hard infrastructure such as town
water, sewer services, and sealed roads. Also it is often the case that reliable grid electricity
and telecommunications are not available to many rural and remote residents. Notably, all
urban areas have access to this sort of infrastructure, including regions on the urban fringe
which have previously captured most of the attention by those concerned about regional
equality. Similarly, institutions are distributed spatially. Access to police, schools
(particularly high schools), tertiary campuses, courts (particularly higher courts), hospitals,
government aged care facilities and a host of other critical institutions are either not available
within reasonable commuting distance (for rural and remote regions), or are available at a
standard that is less than desirable (particularly for some urban fringe regions). This has
obvious implications for consumption of many important public goods and services (Sellers
et al. 2017), but also has oft overlooked implications for regional economies (Grant and
Drew, 2017). We have already noted disparities in typical incomes which coincide with
capital cities in each state and territory and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). State and
territory public servants are located in these capital cities, and the largest portion of federal
public servants is located in the ACT (see Table 7). Public servants attract relatively good
wages and security of employment that may not exist for many other sectors and decisions
about where public servants are located therefore have significant impacts on local economies
(for example, Table 7 provides details of a $7.3b contribution to the ACT economy through
Federal public servant location choice). Moreover, because the funds to pay public servants
are also derived from areas outside of the capital cities it essentially results in the export of
capital from some rural and remote regions (especially where mining royalties and taxes go
into consolidated revenues) to capital cities and the ACT (Grant and Drew, 2017).

Access to markets is also spatially distributed, and hence opportunities to consume nonpublic goods. Specifically, a form of market failure associated with the size and density of
population, means that it is often not economically viable to have a physical presence in
many rural and remote communities. Lack of a physical presence can sometimes be mitigated
through technology (if residents have access to reliable telecommunications), although there
is a price to pay (in choice and consumer satisfaction, but also importantly in the cost to have
the goods posted – and the cost required to pick up the goods (many rural communities do not
receive postal services and have to travel to the nearest Post Office, which can be a
considerable distance away, to pick up the goods despite the fact that they pay at least the
same rate of freight as do residents in urban areas who receive delivery to their door 8).
However, sometimes there can be no mitigation for market failure – where a physical
presence is an absolute imperative (such as for Post Offices, and Banks (particularly for
businesses that need to deposit or withdraw cash to facilitate transactions) – and residents are
either left to travel hundreds of kilometres to consume essential services, or governments
(generally local government) are forced to step in and operate (and hence bear the cost) of an
economically inefficient business (see, for example, Drew and Campbell, 2016).
One way that government redistributes income and wealth is through the taxation system and
it is therefore important to briefly depart from our consideration of manifestations of spatial
inequalities to also reflect on how taxation can mitigate or exacerbate regional inequality. A
few examples will help explicate this point. For instance, take the Goods and Services Tax
(GST) which is levied on fuel (and many other items). The tax per litre of fuel that is paid by
8

owned entity of the Australian federal government.

Submission 17

persons varies considerably according to the region in which one buys the fuel (see Appendix
B). Typically fuel in rural and remote areas costs considerably more than it does in urban
areas (moreover, public transport in rural and remote areas is practically non-existent and vast
distances must be travelled to do one’s shopping or take one’s children to school, hence
relative consumption of fuel in rural and remote areas will typically be higher). Because the
GST is levied on the purchase price, this means that persons living in some areas (particularly
rural and regional areas) tend to pay a higher quantum of GST per litre of fuel, than do their
fellow citizens in urban areas (it is important to note that this also varies on a state and
territory basis). To further complicate matters and introduce more inequality, certain ‘offroad’ industries (agriculture and mining which seem to have converted political power into
rents) receive credits for fuel tax excise, and most businesses can claim back GST inputs.
Notably the situation relating to GST on fuel also relates to most goods that attract the tax –
due to transport costs, market size, and market competition, prices for the majority of goods
in rural and remote areas (when they are available) are generally higher, which means the tax
paid for exactly the same item is often higher in rural and regional areas. Another example
can be found in the exemptions (for the family home) and discounts on capital gains tax (50%
for individuals) which essentially mean that persons who earn income through capital gains
on the family home or speculation receive disproportionate nett gains. Once again, because
income and wealth are spatially distributed – as is, critically, capital gains on the house
values – regional inequality in the impost of taxation, and granting of exemptions and
concession on taxation, follows. Further inequitable rates of taxation also become clear when
one considers business (particularly owner-operator small business) relative to wage earners.
In sum, the way taxation is levied in Australia results in spatial distribution of imposts (and
taxation discounts and exemptions) so that the tax system ‘while nominally progressive, is
much less progressive than it seems’ (Stiglitz, 2013, p. 343).
It is also important to briefly reflect on the role of demographic spatial distributions on
inequality. Population density, population growth, ethnic polarisation, socio-linguistic
integration, age structure, education and welfare transfers are all spatially distributed and all
have been identified as determinants of inequality (Rodriguez-Pose, 2013; Crenshaw, 2010;
Breau, 2015). However, it is likely that there is a good deal of endogeneity between
institutions and demographic spatial distributions; Rodriguez-Pose, 2013), as we have already
alluded to. Moreover, there does not appear to be any empirical analysis of the determinants
of inequality in an Australian context, and this is a significant gap in the literature that must
be addressed if we are to understand regional inequality better in this country.

Putnam (2000, p. 413) in his seminal analysis of the collapse and revival of American
community calls for “social-capital impact statements” for new programs [that are] less
bureaucratic and legalistic than environment impact statements have become, but equally
effective at calling attention to unanticipated consequences’ as a mechanism to help reverse
the trend of increasing disconnectedness from social structures. A similar case could be made
for equality statements to be mandatory for major policy and institutional change – especially
given the clear inequality in the Australian political system, evidence of less than satisfactory
levels of inequality (which, in the case of wealth at least, appear to be at an alarming level),
and the likelihood that extant inequalities in both will give rise to further exacerbation of
inequalities of opportunity in the future 9. Requiring policy and institutional changes to be
accompanied by an equality statement would focus attention on the problem and provide a
level of transparency (and information) relating to decisions that is not currently available to
citizens and the media. Moreover, explicit consideration of equality outcomes arising from
policy and institutional change would provide an important counter-weight to the dominant
form of political decision-making (business case analysis that will almost always be biased in
favour of densely populated regions due to economies of size and density). The emphasis of
such equality statements should be on equality of opportunity (because this is the most
desirable end-state), although some attention must be given to equality of outcomes given the
close links that it has to opportunity.
Similarly an annual report on inequality in Australia 10, compiled by an appropriately
resourced department (hopefully located in a region of inequality) tabled before Parliament
on an annual basis would also serve to put the issue in the spotlight. Moreover, a requirement
of this kind would hopefully result in more comprehensive and sophisticated metrics being
collated and disseminated (for example, the ABS has advised that they do not keep metrics on
the number of public servants and salaries, at a level lower than States/Territories). This
would address the barriers that currently exist to conducting research, so that we can better
understand the causes and potential solutions to higher than desired levels of inequality.
The major sources of regional inequality, that we explicated on above, can also provide a
good guide to some additional, more refined and targeted measures to address the problem
(assuming we don’t wish to see rising, and indeed accelerated, inequality that would occur if
we were to take a Tieboutian approach to the matter (do nothing and let people vote with
their feet; Sellers et al., 2017)).
Because a good deal of inequality arises as a result of inequality in political power (and
moreover, because inequality is likely to have to be mitigated through a political means) it is
important that priority be given to measures which might reduce political inequality (although
we acknowledge that some of these measures would be difficult to implement). These are
some speculative and hopefully provocative ideas. First, there is a clear case for publicly
9

10

Submission 17

funded political campaigns to reduce the disproportionate power of political donors and
lobbyists (Stiglitz, 2013). The rents extracted by these groups mean that the public ultimately
pay for political donations in any case, so publicly funding political campaigns simply makes
the real cost more transparent (and can cap the cost – which can’t currently be achieved
because we don’t know the rate of return that political donors are getting on their
investment). Secondly, we can further regulate the activities of lobbyists, and movements of
politicians (particularly Ministers) into and out of lobbyist ranks (and the corporations that
they represent). Third, we can encourage political parties to be more aware of inequalities in
political representation by requiring that the aforementioned equality statement also includes
a statement on the representativeness of our legislatures. Fourth, there is a clear need for an
anti-corruption commission to be established at a federal level, and for the powers of
Commissions in all jurisdictions to be commensurate with the seriousness of the problems
(particularly rent-seeking). Other reforms, such as the need to ensure regional equality in how
electorate boundaries are designed, removing preferential voting, or even moving to an at
large system of representation (which would eliminate regional political inequality entirely)
face substantial obstacles and probably will never be implemented (although it is easy to
argue that they should be). The point is that we have to start somewhere and making changes
to the funding of campaigns and parties, the power of lobbyists and drawing attention to
inequality in representation is something that can be done to try to mitigate some of the large
inequalities that currently pervade the Australian system of government.
With respect to inequality, in the ability to consume natural resources, it would seem
important to ensure that the burden of constraints are transparent (hence the need for equality
statements) and internalised by all regions (especially where some regions push for
constraints which effects would otherwise not be felt by them). Typically, in economics, it is
argued that a Coasian solution is the most efficient way of dealing with such problems –
specifically, in the absence of transaction costs, the most efficient outcome will result if
parties can bargain to solve the problem of externalities. Because government can enforce
bargains and has sufficient scale to minimise transaction costs, government is in the best
position to find efficient solutions to constraints that they may wish or need to impose on
rural and remote communities (in particular) in pursuit of national objectives.
Inequitable infrastructure is also a problem that will benefit from transparency arising from
inequality reporting. Few residents of urban areas are aware of the fact that their rural peers
live mostly with worse infrastructure than many developing nations provide for their citizens
(although most people know that infrastructure in remote areas is deplorable). Merely getting
the issue into the spotlight will be a great advance on the current state of affairs (people in
Sydney might be concerned less with their billion dollar sport stadium upgrades if they knew
that a few hundred kilometres away residents didn’t have town water, sealed roads or sewer
services). The infrastructure inequality can’t be addressed quickly (if at all) simply because
the backlog is so great, however, improving the system of grants made to local government
and state governments – which are supposed to facilitate horizontal fiscal equalisation but fall

Page 17

Submission 17

well short of this lofty goal due to flawed allocation models and legislation 11 – would be a
significant step forward (see, for example Grant and Drew, 2017; Drew and Campbell, 2016;
Drew and Dollery, 2015). It has also been suggested in the literature that decentralising
government goods and service provision, combined with consolidation could also result in
greater equality (see, for example Wei, 2015), although this is unlikely to be a practical
solution given Australia’s Constitution.
Similarly, inequitable access to critical institutions would have a spotlight cast on it, were
annual reporting of regional inequality implemented. In some instances, institutions could be
relocated to provide for more regional equity in access – although this would be viable in
only a limited number of cases. Investment in technologies and changes to policies to allow
people greater access services through technology, would help in some other instances.
However, in most cases inequality in access to institutions can probably not be directly
mitigated, certainly not in the short term. If this is the case, then some form of transfer from
those who benefit disproportionally through access to institutions to those who are unable to
access institutions would be one way of dealing with the problem.
Inequitable access to market goods can also be partially addressed by ensuring that all
Australians have access to reliable telecommunications. However, it would also seem to be
important to ensure that freight charges are subsidised or regulated to reduce the deleterious
effect on spending capacity when market failure dictates access of this kind. It is also critical
that where lower tiers of government are forced to operate businesses to address market
failure at a loss, that this burden is specifically addressed through additional allocations in
horizontal fiscal equalisation inter-governmental grant transfers (present allocations only
consider ‘standard’ costs for providing ‘regular’ local government services).
The annual statement of inequality should also draw attention to how taxation imposts,
concessions and exemptions are spatially distributed. Beyond increasing the level of
transparency – which would do much to dispel the myth of progressive taxation –
governments can also make changes to taxation policy to address extant inequality. Thus
changes could be made to existing exemptions, rates of taxation and concessions, although
these will all have implications for the economy (some of which would not be tenable). Better
still, transfers can be made to try to equalise effective rates of taxation, or a combination of
both approaches could be made. Specific attention should be paid to how the GST is spatially
distributed and also how the fuel taxes are levied (especially on communities that do not have
access to public transport). The important thing, once again, is to expose inequality in the
taxation system, mitigate this wherever possible, and ensure that future policy changes do not
exacerbate extant inequality.
In summary, ‘every law, every regulation, every institutional arrangement has distributive
consequences’ (Stiglitz 2013, p. 66). The first step in dealing with regional inequality is to
admit that profound regional inequality does exist, to collect the data, and get the issue onto

The idea that some regions could catch up, when all regions get a minimum payment, defies simple logic.

the political agenda (encapsulated in our plea for an annual regional inequality report).
However, if we are to avoid the deleterious outcomes associated with ever increasing levels
of inequality – housing affordability crises, inefficient use of human resources, inefficient
migration of capital and labour, political disillusionment, destructive rent-seeking and civil
disobedience – then the step must be taken.
