Introduction
Regional Capitals Australia (RCA) is pleased to present this submission for
consideration by the Standing Economics References Committee (The Committee)
into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia. RCA welcomes
the potential for the inquiry’s outcome to inform the Federal Government’s approach
to regional development.

Regional	  Capital	  Cities	  
RCA is a growing alliance of 25 local governments across the nation, representing Australia’s regional capital
cities.
Regional capital cities are home to almost four million people and service the needs of another four million
Australians who live in surrounding areas.
Our mission is to provide a platform to champion the strategic importance and sustainable development of
regional capital cities around the nation.
Regional capital cities are not defined by size, but by the role the city plays in the wider region. These cities
act as service ‘hubs’ and perform a ‘capital city’ role within the region, providing a central point to access
essential infrastructure, services, business, employment and education.
The services and infrastructure available in regional capital cities are accessed by local residents as well as
those in surrounding towns and rural areas. Every day, eight million Australians rely on a regional capital city
for their everyday needs.
Australia’s regional capital cities jointly generate $225 billion per annum, or more than 15 per cent of
national economic activity.
Regional capital cities are growing, with an extra one million people are expected to call these cities home by
2020. RCA member cites should be seen as the liveable and affordable alternatives for people and
businesses seeking to escape congested metropolitan cities. Further, it is the position of RCA that a concerted
focus on growth and investment for regional capital cities is key to securing sustainable growth in our regions.

Re g i o n a l C a p i t a l s A u s t r a l i a ’ s S u b m i s s i o n O v e r v i e w
The RCA submission aims to provide the Australian government with the basis for a proactive regional
development investment and policy framework that will grow regional capital cities, whilst addressing two of
Australia’s challenges to achieving economic and social outcomes:
•
•

Congestion in big metropolitan cities; and
Continuation of access to services and infrastructure in small rural towns.

Submission 60

Position Overview
Australia has a growth problem that is creating inequality in economic and social opportunity.
According to the latest ABS data, Australia’s overall population increases by one person every 1 minute
and 23 seconds. This trend will ensure the national population will almost double in 50 years. According to
the Chair of Infrastructure Australia, Chair Julieanne Alroe, a large majority (75%) of this population growth
will continue to occur in big metropolitan capitals.
Crushing congestion resulting in record commuting times (predicted to grow to an extra five hour peak
travel period by 2030) is a daily grind for residents and businesses despite significant amounts of
investment into infrastructure.
Accommodating this growth will be challenging for Federal and State Governments, as estimates show the
cost of addressing this growth will be approximately $700 billion.
The cost of growth is starting to hit the pockets of residents, with the average cost of a home in Melbourne
being over $900,000 and Sydney $1.18 million .
On the opposite end of the scale, the population of smaller rural towns has been declining over a long
period of time. Towns highly reliant on primary production have been the worst impacted. Technological
advances in agriculture and manufacturing mean that while there has been economic growth in the sectors,
this growth has not equated to more local jobs.
The knock on effect of this reduction in traditional employment opportunities has lead to an overall reduction in
the town’s population and simultaneously a reduction in the availability of education and health services as
well as economic and liveability facilities.
In launching the latest round of national infrastructure priorities, Ms Alroe stated planning for growth was “a
challenge that [Australia] can’t afford to manage passively”.
Regional Capitals Australia agrees - when aiming to deal with growth and decline there is no place for passive
strategy, policy or investments. Yet most predictions of the future are clearly based on the passive policy
settings of today – rapid urban sprawl and rural decline. This is something that Regional Capitals Australia
(RCA) is advocating strongly to change.
The rapid growth of the major metropolitan cities and steady decline of rural towns does not have to be a fait
accompli. A proactive policy should carve out an increasing role for Australia’s regional capital cities. RCA
member cities can be the solution to the crushing congestion in the big metropolitan capitals and the struggle
to maintain access to areas experiencing population decline. Our member cities should be considered to be:
1. Strong service centres providing access to jobs, essential services and infrastructure for those living in the
surrounding rural towns; and
2. The liveable, investable and affordable alternative to the major metropolitan capitals.
The time to act is now. Growing our regional capital cities is critical; with adequate planning and support by
governments essential to facilitating this objective. Actions to building the economic capability of Australia’s
regional capital cities through investments that drive economic diversification, along with proactive policies
which aims to increase the development and population of regional capitals cities can deliver more liveable,
equitable, and efficient outcomes for all Australians.

Addressing a 100 year trend
Australian cities, towns and rural areas have undergone significant change over the last 100 years, however
as outlined above, this change has been most transformational in regional Australia.
The Australian Government’s Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) report:
Evolution of Australia’s Towns (2014) mapped this change and clearly showed that over this period Australia’s
population has trended towards a preference for people wanting to live in urban environments.
As the images below show, in 1911 (Figure 1) the majority of people lived in towns of 3000 people or less; by
1961 (Figure 2) the preference was for cities of 15,000 – 30,000. By 2006, large regional cities were growing
faster than the state capitals (Figure 3 and 4).
The report stated: “The consistent decline in the share of Australia’s regional population compared to the
major cities occurred in parallel with increasing urbanisation within regional areas... while the population share
for towns and rural residents [in regional area] as a whole has been declining...regional cities have and
continue to grow” (p66).

This change in living patterns was also highlighted in the recent Productivity Commission (PC) review:
Transitioning Regional Economies – Interim Report (2017). The PC also concluded there was a trend of
consolidation from smaller towns to larger regional centres.
The report confirmed that the effect of a globally transitioning economy was one reason for this growth. The
reported noted that while there was considerable growth in Australia’s agricultural sector, the rise of
automation and overall efficiencies in this sector meant there had been a decline in the number of people
employed in this sector. A similar pattern of job losses were also occurring in the manufacturing sector.
The report also confirmed a trend towards service-based employment and that regional cities with strong
service sectors had growing populations and economies. The PC highlighted that this change in regional
populations and economies could be attributed towards:
“...productivity, technological change, demography, personal choices and increasingly connected regions
through trade in services. The ease of transport today and the capacity to undertake transactions using the

Inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia - RCA Submission - Page 6

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 60

internet, mobile phones and satellite-based communications systems has facilitated this trend. There is also
greater amenity associated with larger regional centres as well as access to a wider range of services
(including schools, aged care services, hospitals and universities)” (p20.)

Addressing Regional Decline Through Hubs and Spokes
There is an untested view amongst some stakeholders that opportunity in regional Australia is largely
based on investing in regional cities at the expense of smaller rural towns, which are being left behind with
a lack of opportunity and basic amenity.
It has long been the position of RCA that creating strong regional capital cities that act as service ‘hubs’ for the
entire region creates equity. In short, regions need cities.
Regional capital cities aim to provide a central point within regions, facilitating access to essential
infrastructure, services, business, employment and education. In essence, these cities aim to perform a
‘capital city’ role within their regions.
There is significant end user data demonstrating that facilities (such as universities and sporting centres) in
regional capital cities are truly focused on supporting their respective regions. There are also individual hub
and spoke models that operate in regional areas (such as regional health networks), which deliver coordinated
services for a region from a central hub.
It is however true to say that utilising a hub and spoke method to service and support infrastructure delivery is
not consistent across portfolios affecting regional development. As such, RCA wanted to test the idea that
strengthening regional capitals cities does in fact produce a wider regional benefit across a range of indicators.
To meet this objective, RCA partnered with the Regional Australia Institute (RAI) to map the hub and spoke
networks in regions. The outcome of this work is a report titled: Regional City Hubs and Hinterland Spokes: A
national network supporting Australia’s regional development. The findings are discussed below.

Regional City Hubs and Hinterland Spokes - A National Network Supporting
Australia’s Regional Development
Overview and Findings
The premise and methodology of Regional City Hubs and Hinterland Spokes was based on a similar network
approach applied in the European Union, which revealed that nations who invest in this model stimulate local
development, achieve stronger economic growth, enhance labour productivity and a more resilient economy.
IMPORTANT: A note on the data contained in this report – some of the data contained in the report prepared
by the RAI is based on 2011 census data, as such some of the regional cities and rural towns are likely to
show lower ranks in access to or distance from a service if an investment has taken place in the last 6 years. It
is RCA and RAI’s intention to release an updated report at the end of May with the 2016 data. We expect this
report will show the regional benefit of investing in regional cities, with the 2011 and 2016 reports tol serve as
benchmarks for the future.
Outcomes
The outcomes of RAI’s analysis showed that regional capital cities (hubs) are very connected to their small
rural towns (hinterland spokes) through a network of roads, jobs and essential services.
The analysis also found hub and spoke relationships stretch across regions to form a functional network that
delivers jobs, and access to health, education and finance. There were two clear findings for policy makers to
consider:

Inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia - RCA Submission - Page 7

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 60

1. Hub and Spoke Networks comprise of two important areas:
–
–

Structural: physical infrastructure connections such as road and rail; and
Functional: role and service connections such as health or education.

2. The strength of the regional capital city affects the whole region:
–
–

Smaller rural towns with higher ranked access to services and infrastructure are located in a region where
the regional capital city also had a higher level of service and infrastructure.
Smaller rural towns with low ranked access to services and infrastructure are located in a region, where
the regional capital city also had a lower level of service and infrastructure.

Both structural and functional networks are critical to achieving economic outcomes and as such, it is the
position of RCA that models across a range of service areas should be mapped out, planned for and invested
in for the benefit of the regions.

Breaking It Down
To arrive at this conclusion, RAI identified 31 regional capital cities (RCA members) and 97 smaller rural towns
located in surrounding regions, then examined the distance from and access to:
–
–
–
–
–
–

Employment
Health services
Education
Financial services
Airports
Ports

The purpose of conducting the case studies was to understand:
1. How communities moved around regions for employment purposes; and
2. What distance from the hub means for spokes
Employment Mapped through Journey to Work Data
Using a national picture of journey to work data (2011) a clear picture emerges of jobs in hubs and workers in
spokes (see Figure 5). Australia is a nation where cities are connected through jobs.

Figure 5: Australian national journey to work network (2011) - Source: Regional Australia Institute

Inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia - RCA Submission - Page 8

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 60

Closer analysis of this journey to work shows that similar to the role metropolitan capital cities have in being
economic hubs for employment, regional capital cities are also hubs, crucial to connecting regional and rural
Australians to wider employment markets.
To date, there has been little effort to understand the relationship between regional capital cities (hubs) and
the smaller rural towns (spokes). The data journey across the 31 regions however shows a clear trend towards
a networked effect, where employment is being accessed in regional capital cities from those living in the
smaller rural towns.
Below are samples of the journey to work data from four regions around Australia:
1. Wagga Wagga located in the Riverina region in New South Wales
2. Mackay located in the Whitsunday region in Queensland
3. Albany located in the South West region in Western Australia; and
4. Horsham located in the Wimmera region in Victoria.
Figure 6: Wagga Wagga and the Riverina region

Figure 8: Albany and the South West Region

Figure 7: Mackay and the Whitsunday Region

Figure 9:Horsham and the Wimmera Region

The thicker olive-coloured lines demonstrate movement from the smaller towns into the regional capital city regarding access to employment. Red lines indicate freight
movements and the light green lines indicate movements from smaller towns to other smaller towns.

As you can see from these examples some smaller rural towns in each region have a stronger (olive green
line) economic jobs link to the regional capital city. The reason for this not known and requires further
investigation to establish the drivers. As Australian region’s continue to be at the forefront of economic
transitions, moving away from high levels of employment in traditional sectors such as agriculture and
manufacturing, there is a need for those living in regional areas to have access to alternative employment
options, for example service and knowledge sector jobs like those found in regional capital cities. Much more
needs to be done to ensure access to and creation of a diverse range of jobs if the economic and social future
of regions is to be secured.

Access to Health and Education
To examine the status of hub and spoke relationships in regional capital cities, the RAI also investigated the
extent to which the existence of high or low levels of health and education services in a regional capital city
was also present in smaller regional and rural towns.
The RAI’s method was to use elements from its Insight dataset themed around education, health and business
services in addition to census data showing places of work and residence. Services and infrastructure were
measured with the following indicators:
•
•
•
•
•

Access to financial services (business services) as percentage of population employed
Access to health services as a percentage of population employed
Access to tertiary education as a percentage of population enrolled
Population growth (ABS data)
Distance from an airport or port (GIS mapping)

As a measure of strength or weakness, each regional capital city or rural town (measured by Local
Government Area) received a rank in relation to access to a service such as health, education or distance from
a facility such as an airport or port (refer above).
The ranking of each regional capital city or rural town was achieved by measuring each of the 563 LGAs
around Australia. The ranks have been grouped into percentile bands. A score of 1 means the area ranks in
the top 10 percentile of all LGAs in Australia in access to or distance from a service or piece of infrastructure.
A score of 10 indicates the city or town is within the bottom 10 percentile of all LGAs.
In breaking down the scoring we make the following comments:
•
•
•

A score of 1-3 is considered to be excellent to good level of access to or distance from a service
A score of 4-6 is considered to be mid to ordinary level of access to or distance from a service
A score of 7-10 is considered to be poor level of access to or distance from a service.

Micro Level Analysis
To understand if there is a macro regional trend, an explanation of micro level data is required. Using the
example of regions mentioned above, each table below breaks down the rank (relative strength) of the access
and distance in regional capital cities as well as the smaller rural towns also located in the region.

In the Riverina, Wagga Wagga is the regional capital city - the city has access to a regional university, a
hospital and an airport. As you can see from the table, Wagga Wagga has ranks of 1-3 for access and
distance to all indicators, except a port – being an inland city this is not unexpected. Since 2011, Wagga
Wagga has had a major investment into medical facilities and as such, when the report is updated with 2016
data it is expected that the health indicators will rise for the whole region.
The regional towns surrounding Wagga Wagga identified as having a stronger hub and spoke relationship
predominately have ranks of 4-6 (mid to ordinary) access and distance to all indicators. Interestingly there are
also some ranks of 1 in the rural towns, reflecting the strength of the local university (Charles Sturt) and TAFE
sector. Again, these towns have a poor access to a port as the towns are located inland.

Mackay is the regional capital city in the Whitsunday region. As you can see from the table, Mackay has much
lower ranks in access to health and education services, which also cause poor outcomes for the smaller rural
towns. These ranks reflect the historical low educational and health outcomes for this region. Since 2011, the
university has had significant upgrades and merged with the local TAFE, so we expect to see better outcomes
when the report is updated. Mackay however performed better in the access to financial services and
connectivity to air and seaports - this is due to the city being a mining and agricultural business and transport
hub.

In the South West region, Albany is the regional capital city. As you can see from the table, Albany has
excellent to good levels of access to education, health services and financial services. Additionally as has
been demonstrated in the tables above, rural towns in the South West region have mid to ordinary level
access (4-6/7). Interestingly the whole region has excellent levels of access to education, which again can be
attributed to the strength of the Western Australia University campus in Albany.

Horsham Hindmarsh

Horsham is the regional capital city in the Wimmera region. Once again this table highlights that where
Horsham has an excellent or good rank for a service, the rural towns in the region have a corresponding
strength although with a mid rating.
Macro Level Analysis
To understand the policy implications of this work, RAI also undertook a macro level analysis of access to
health and education across all regional capital cities (31) and the surrounding rural towns (97). The focus of
this analysis was to identify a regional trend and also if the size of a city and rural town had any basis for level
of access. The findings are below:
Tertiary Education:
The following summarises the average tertiary education access scores and the average score for their
spokes. The findings generally show:
–
–

All regional capital cities have higher than average access to tertiary education ranks than small rural
towns
If regional capital cities have better tertiary education access ranks, so do the smaller rural towns

Figure 13:Tertiary Education Access Scores
This table however shows population size is not a definitive contributor to the size of a city. Large regional
capital cities have a lower average rank (4.8) and as such, the rural towns also have a lower rank (6.9). This is
in comparison to the smaller regional capital cities, which have an average rank (3.6) in the hub and (5.0) in
the hinterland.
It is acknowledged that many of the cities that sit in the 100,00 – 250,000 population band such as Ballarat,
Toowoomba and Geelong are also a commutable distance to a major metropolitan city where national

universities are present. This may affect the tertiary education investment in the regional capital city. It is also
recognised that these cities have had significant investment into local universities and TAFEs since 2011.

affects the rural towns’ ranks
The more remote a regional capital city is, the poorer access it has to health access which also affects the
rural towns’ access.

Figure 15: Regional Capital City Access to Tertiary Education and Health
This table shows that the population size of the regional capital city does matter. As regional capital cities get
smaller in population, their average access to health services is reduced. As a result, smaller regional capital
cities have poorer access (4.1) as do the spokes (5.8). As smaller regional capitals cities (50,000 or less) are
also servicing more smaller rural towns, access to health really does start to become a significant problem.
It is also clear that remoteness is a substantial challenge. The figure below shows that the more remote a
regional capital city, is the less access the city and rural town have to health services. The trend of better
access in the regional capital city equally better access in the rural town is however still present in this
scenario.

The Importance Of Hub And Spoke Analysis
RCA acknowledges the case studies above are an interim piece of work that requires further analysis. Despite
this, we believe there is an indication of a trend in the cities and towns which could improve service and
infrastructure delivery in regions.
It is our position that the hub and spoke relationship is a valuable tool for analysing regions, identifying
strengths and disparity in key policy delivery areas which when adjusted, will allow both cities and regions to
thrive.
It is the position of both RCA and the RAI that the Government should further investigate this model to allow a
clearer understanding of how regional capital cities and rural spokes can be invested in to ensure equity of
opportunity in Australia.

RCA Recommendation:

	  

•

Further investigate the mapping of the service ‘hub’ role of all regional capital cities as a matter
of priority; and

•

Use this information to plan and prioritise investments identified in the Government’s
development Regions 2030: Unlocking Opportunity Program and the Smart Cities – City Deals
program.

National Urban Policy
Potential of Regional Capital Cities
The case for building strong regional capital cities has been addressed in the section above, however for
regional cities to reach their full potential of generating and additional $378 billion in economic output1
immediate action is needed. According to the RAI, the appropriate level of planning will allow regional cities to
“produce twice as much as all the new economy industries produce in today’s metropolitan cities” by 2031.
The following section highlights RCA’s position on what the priorities for this planning should be.

	  
City Deals
RCA welcomed the Government’s announcements in 2016 regarding a regional cities stream of the City Deals
process. This was on the basis that the development of a network of socially and economically thriving
regional capital cities is critical to the nation’s growth, and many of our members have cited the receipt of a
City Deal as a game-changer for their community and economy.
According to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC), City Deals are a new arrangement
between the Australian Government, a state or territory government, and local governments, which aims to
make Australian cities better places to live in and do business.
It is intended that governments, industry and communities will develop collective plans (which could be seen
as master plans) for growth through City Deals. Parties to the plan who intend to commit to the actions,
investments, reforms and governance are also needed to implement them. Through making the most of new
and existing investments of governments, City Deals will set out the specific investments and reforms needed
2
to unlock business and industry development and ensure community wellbeing .
On launching the government’s cities policy the “Smart Cities Plan” which City Deals encompass, both the
Hon. Fiona Nash, Minister for Minister for Local Government and Territories, Regional Communications and
Regional Development and the Hon. Angus Taylor – Assistant Minister for Cities stated the plan should be
3
considered ‘a plan for the regions’ . The Assistant Minister went further, stating:
“Regional cities are incredibly important to the future of the regions and getting our policy right on regional
cities is a very, very important piece of work.
I’m absolutely convinced that harnessing the potential of our regional cities depends on long-term planning for
4
the future and building cities that can really attract people to work, to live, to play and to enjoy their lives. ”
In November 2016, the Assistant Minister announced a competitive process to identify future Regional City
5
Deals (in addition to the announced Townsville and Launceston City Deals) was under development .
While City Deals have been highlighted as the new paradigm and investment for urban Australia, the
Government has chosen recipient cities, so there is little understanding of how competitiveness will be
assessed.

Submission 60

In a submission to the DPMC, RCA outlined the collective view of our membership on what a competitive
process should look like and highlighted the need for all our member cities to be considered eligible to apply.
RCA made specific recommendations regarding what process considerations should be applied. This
submission can be found on the Submissions page of the RCA Website.

Does The Size of a City Matter?
In our submission to DPMC, RCA stated that cities of all sizes should be included eligible for a City Deal. The
basis of our position has been supported by the RAI in the release of the latest release the: Lighting Up our
Great Small Cities: Challenging Misconceptions report (2017).
The report examined the performance (population and economic growth) of 31 of Australia’s regional cities
(with populations ranging from 546,000 to 50,000). The report revealed that these cities collectively expanded
their economies at 3 per cent per year from 2001-2013. They share comparable economic performance with
our major cities across the key measures of growth, output, participation, and productivity (refer Figures 6 and
7 below).
Additionally, the report showed there was little difference between the smaller regional cities as compared to
6
the larger regional cities .

Figure 17 – Comparison on output between small and big regional cities

Figure 18: Regional cities share of the metropolitan cities economic performance

The report also showed there was a robust historical population growth at an average of 1.6 per cent per
annum from 2002 to 2013, and strong population projections to 2026 showing an expected total population
7
increase of 16 per cent (refer 8 figure below) .

Figure19 – Projected population growth across 31 of Australia’s regional cities

RCA believes our cities have great potential and now is the time to plan for and develop a network of
economically and socially sustainable regional capital cities.
As we can see above, the policies should not only focus on the largest cities, smaller regional cities are also
socially and economically important to the nation but also to regions themselves.

Measuring the Policy – Smart Cities Plan – City Deals and the National Cities
Performance Framework
A measurement of achievement must be established to ensure the policy interventions are successful. It is the
position of RCA that properly measuring the performance of our Regional Capital Cities will support
interventions designed to improve how Australian cities grow.
In November 2017, the Government launched the National Cities Performance Framework. The framework
however only includes a small number of regional capital cities – those with populations of 85,000 or more.
Through this framework, RCA members like Albury-Wodonga, Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Launceston,
Mackay, and Toowoomba have been shown as not only the best places to live, but also excellent choices for
businesses to make their next investment.
As the work of the RAI highlights – cities of all sizes however have social and economic value. The exclusion
of the remaining regional cities significantly undersells the contribution and potential of regional Australia. It is
the position of RCA that monitoring all regional cities will significantly increase the understanding of how
these cities function. This monitoring will highlight investment opportunities and identify how the service hub
role can be strengthened - a stated objective of the Smart Cities plan.

Missing Analyses for Regional Capital Cities
Proper planning for the future of all regional capital cities requires specific analysis of all cities, and not just as
part of a wider region analysis.
Work undertaken by RCA to compare three sources of Government reporting (State of Australian Cities,
Progress in Australian Regions and Regional Online) has highlighted there are real gaps in how the Australian
government collects and reports on regional city data (refer to Appendix A).

RCA believes this is attributed to the way the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) collects data under levels
of delamination. For the purposes of this submission, we have highlighted Statistical Area (SA) 4 and
Statistical Area (SA) 3 as they relate to regional capital cities; specifically the following:
•
SA4s were designed using a number of criteria, which reflect a balance between respective
considerations. A minimum of 100,000 persons was set for the SA4s, although there are some exceptions to
this. In regional areas, SA4s tend to have populations closer to the minimum (100,000 - 300,000).

•

SA3s are designed to provide a regional breakdown of Australia. They generally have a population of
between 30,000 and 130,000 people. In regional areas, SA3s represent the area serviced by regional cities
which have a population over 20,000 people.
For regional cities that have populations over 100,000, there is a suite of data available to understand how the
city is performing – in many cases highlighting the many competitive advantages for potential businesses and
residents has when compared to major metropolitan cities.
In cities under 100,000 however, persons data is collected for that Regional Capital Cities as part of the
regional area. This lack of an analysis of smaller regional capital cities will have an effect on the ability of the
leaders of that city to highlight the competitive advantage or a barrier to investment for the city – the very
things that will affect further population and economic growth. Missing indicators also mean the effect of
investment into regional cities cannot easily be measured, compared and as a result, planned for. This is at
odds with the stated objectives in the Smart Cities Policy.
The gaps relate to two key areas:
•

Liveability: air pollution, housing affordability, traffic congestion, average commuting time, proximity
to arts, culture and sporting facilities; and

•

Connectivity: access (direct or indirect connections) to national and international markets by road,
rail, air and reliability of broadband and mobile service.

It is the position of RCA that as data is collected against LGAs to support ABS figures, there is scope to
develop a specific dataset measuring performance in all Regional Capital Cities (of varying populations).
This would enable the production of data sets, which would invariably assist in master planning for
Regional Capital Cities
RCA Recommendation: The Committee seek to highlight the importance of prioritising the delivery of
the Government’s regional city stream of City Deals to Regional Capital Cities by requesting the
Government:
•

Increase the number of regional cities to be measured under the National Cities Performance
Framework to 51 – to align with the objectives of the Smart Cities Plan and to enable regional city
deals to be measured;

•

Develop a specific dataset measuring performance in all regional capital cities (of varying
populations).

More than 4 million Australians live in regional capital cities. An additional 4
million people in surrounding areas access the services, infrastructure, jobs
and education in regional capital cities. Each day 8 million Australians rely on
regional capital cities for their every day needs.
RCA was formed to provide a voice for our member cities largest regional
capital cities throughout the country, making sure the needs of our communities
are met and that the growth of our member cities remains a priority for the
Australian Government.
Regional Capitals Australia knows that our regional capital cities are important contributors to regional
and national economies. However, often regional cities are discussed in national policy context as
perpetual laggards, isolated, too small to matter and with little future potential. But, there is little
evidence to back up these erroneous claims.
We have a clear focus of how we want our cities to grow, as service hubs with strong regional
economies and growing populations.
Our work with the Regional Australia Institute is investigating the core role regional capitals have as
service hubs. This report provides the evidence for assessing how important regional capital hubs are to
their hinterland spokes for jobs, access to tertiary education, health and financial services.
Our cities are the forefront of change, with this report we can make sure that our regions and regional
capital cities can get our fair share of investment, so they continue to the liveable, investable and
affordable solution to Australia’s growth problem!

Mayor Shane van Styn
Chair of Regional Capitals Australia

Australia has a very limited knowledge about the role that regional
capitals play in the wider Australian economy and within our networks
of public and private services.
This makes it harder than it should be for well informed decisions to be
made within government and at the regional level.
Using publically available data, this report explores the role that
regional capitals play in connecting their surrounding hinterlands to jobs and services. It demonstrates
clearly that regional cities and their hinterlands form a strong, interdepenent national network that is
crucial to the functioning of regional economies and communities.
The foundational evidence in this report, alongside the wider work of the Regional Australia Institute on
our Great Small Cities, challenges us to think in much more sophisticated ways about how we can
develop regional capitals and their surrounding regions, for the benefit of all Australians.

Summary
Regional cities are assumed to be the hubs for access and delivery of essential services like health,
tertiary education and finance for their rural hinterlands. Yet this assumption is untested.
This report uses evidence from Australia’s regional capitals to identify the relationship between
hubs and spokes for access to jobs and essential services for economic development.
This work has revealed four facts about regional city hub and hinterland spoke relationships.
First, regional city hubs connect with each other and their hinterland spokes in a network
through infrastructure (e.g. roads) and functions (e.g. jobs and service access).
Second, if regional city hubs provide better services access (health, tertiary education
and finance) their hinterland spokes generally also provide better local access to
services.
Third, larger population hubs tend to have better access to services and so do their
hinterland spokes.
Fourth, more remote regional city hubs tend to have poorer access to services and so do
their hinterland spokes.
These findings demonstrate that regional city hubs are strongly connected to their hinterlands and
are essential service and job providers for their connected spokes. It also shows that when these
hubs have better service access, local hinterland service access is also stronger.
Together, these hub and spoke relationships stretch across Australia to form a functional network
that delivers jobs, and access to health, education and finance for the majority of regional
Australians.
The Australian Government has a legislated role in coordinating and supporting national networks.
To date these have been primarily defined as infrastructure networks. This work indicates that
functional networks, which connect workforces with jobs, deliver services and support regional
economic development are also nationally significant.
Better understanding and nurturing this network is an important consideration for national
investments in regional economic development and for national services policies.

Context
Regional cities are hubs, crucial to connecting regional and rural
Australians to wider markets, customers and ideas. There has been
little effort to understand the network of regional cities (hubs) and
their hinterlands (spokes).
In the network, all regional cities are hubs for smaller LGAs, and
all rural LGAs are a spoke to a regional city.
Hub and spoke networks, have been gaining recognition globally
since the early 1990’s as a way to deliver access and services to
stimulate regional economic development.
The European Union has invested in its hub and spoke network
(called polycentric) to achieve competitiveness of cities, regional
development and decentralisation i. The contested research
indicates that nations who invest in a hub and spoke model to
stimulate local development achieve stronger economic growth,
enhance labour productivity and have a more resilient economyii.
Networks comprise of two important connections, both are critical
to achieving economic outcomes:iii
•
•

Structural - physical infrastructure connections like road
and rail.
Functional – role and service connections like health or
education.

Accounting for both connections is critical to creating effective
networks for regional economic development.

ABOUT THE REPORT
This evidence report provides
Regional Capitals Australia
(RCA) with advice on the role
of regional cities and
hinterlands in the hub and
spoke network of LGA’s across
Australia. It uses transparent,
publically available data for
the first time to show how the
network of hubs and spokes
delivers; jobs, health services,
tertiary education and
financial services to regional
Australians.

Regional city networks in Australia
Recent work by the Productivity Commission has identified that better functioning towns and cities
have the potential to deliver a $29 billion increase in the size of the Australian economy. This work
adds to the growing national interest in delivering regional cities and towns that reach their full
economic potential.
In the Australian policy context, the government has a long tradition of using centralisation and
decentralisation policy to demote or promote the role regional cities play in delivering services to
rural areas iv. However, this is not recognising the connections these cities have to each other and
their regional hinterland. In addition, decentralisation and centralisation ignores the different roles
cities play within a network. Focusing on decentralising from the 70’s to centralising in 80’s
produced a ‘no net gain’ for the nation in the long run – a network approach has the potential to
offer national benefits with regional economic gains.
There is a need in Australia to understand our regional city hubs and hinterland spokes network.

The Australian hub and spoke network
Network of infrastructure connections
Australia has a recognised network of regional city hubs and spokes in the National Land Transport
Network (NLTN) (Figure 1a). This is a federal government network of hubs and spokes that
facilitates regional development. The foundations for this network date from 1901 and have
evolved to cover transport improvements (e.g. cars and faster trains).

Figure 1a. Australian national road and rail
network as designated by the National Land
Transport Network

Figure 1b. Australian national journey to
work network (2011)

Source: Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and
Regional Economics, 2014,

This structural hub and spoke network is national and therefore is not ‘owned’ by anyone. Networks
have devolved governance structures, but there is a role in coordination. For example, the National
Land Transport Network remains with the States, and the Commonwealth contributes maintenance
funding on condition that the States appropriately maintain the network and provide agreed data
on the condition, resources and use of the network.
The National Commission of Audit in 2014 stated for the NLTN,
Economic efficiency is more likely to be achieved if analysis of national
networks is undertaken at a national level and decisions coordinated
across levels of government, while recognising the need to respect the
sovereignty of States in their own sphere. v
However, networks have both structural (i.e. road and rail) and functional (i.e. service delivery or
access) connections. Currently, there is no recognition at the national level that our city and
hinterland network is more than road and rail, and yet the functional network is crucial in delivering
jobs and services for national economic development.

Network of functional connections
A functional network has a focus on the functions a hub provides to its spokes; they may include
jobs, access to services etc. This work considers four functional networks, job provision, health access,
tertiary education and financial services for the RCA members. Further insight on data and methods
is at the end of this report.

Job provision services of regional city hubs
Using journey to work data for Australia’s regional capitals, a clear picture emerges of jobs in hubs
and workers in spokes (see Figure 1b). Australia is a nation where cities connect through jobs. Many
journeys to work in northern western Australia originate from south eastern Queensland, Melbourne
and Perth.
Evidence offers three findings:
•
•
•

Regional cities are spokes for metropolitan cities.
Hinterland LGA’s are spokes for regional city hubs.
Regional city hubs provide jobs, for residents who live in hinterland spokes.

From Figure 1b there are clearly big cities acting as hubs (e.g. Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney,
Adelaide) and regional cities as spokes (e.g. Geraldton, Townsville).
In addition, all regional cities can be considered a hub for smaller LGAs, and spoke for
metropolitan cities. Figure 2 shows journey to work data for Wagga Wagga and Greater
Bendigo. Both regional city hubs create jobs, which attract hinterland residents into the hub.
Identifying that regional cities are job hubs for hinterland spokes.

Health services hub and spoke network
Health service access is an important role that regional cities play across Australia. Recent work by
the Productivity Commission has identified that better access and streamlined health services are
essential to improving the productivity of the workforce and national economic performance.
Evidence offers four findings:
•
•
•
•

If a regional city has a better health services access score (i.e. closer to 1) then, its
hinterland spokes will have comparatively better scores with better access to health
services.
The poorer the regional city hub’s access to health, the poorer the hinterland spokes access
to health services.
The smaller (in population) a regional city LGA is, the poorer its health services access score.
The more remote a regional city, the poorer access it has to health access and its hinterland
spokes have the lowest access to health services.

In Table 1 data shows that as regional cities get smaller in population their average access to
health services is ranked in a lower decile (i.e. a bigger number). Clearly, the smaller regional cities
(less than 50,000 people) service a higher proportion of rural LGAs (87 per cent of spokes) and
have lower access to health services. Table 1 shows smaller regional cities have poorer access (4.1
decile) as do their hinterland spokes (5.8 decile). While big regional cities, regional centres and
regional metropolis all have health services access in the top 25 per cent of the nation (2.5 decile).
The remoteness and accessibility of the regional city has a large impact on the health service access
for both the hub and spoke. Figure 3 shows that the more remote a regional city is, its health decile
score increases, showing a poorer access to health services. The data again supports the role that
regional cities have higher access to health services than their hinterland hubs and that the better
access (i.e. lower scores) of the hub, the better access found in the regional hinterlands.

Tertiary education hub and spoke network
RCA member regional cities have a clear role in providing tertiary education services to their
hinterlands. Providing tertiary education is seen as a crucial ingredient for regional economic
development because it attracts and retains young people longer in regions, it provides necessary
skilling and qualifications for local workers now and capacity for them to earn higher incomes into
the future. Tertiary education institutions also attract workforce to the region by creating jobs of
higher income levels and in areas of high creativity and learning.
Table 2 summarizes the hub cities, their average tertiary education access scores and the average
score for their spokes. The findings show:
•
•
•
•

All regional city hubs have higher average access to tertiary education scores (i.e. closer to
one) than their hinterlands.
If regional cities have better access to tertiary education, so do their hinterlands.
There is a spread of access to tertiary education across hubs and hinterlands, not strongly
related to city size.
More remote hubs and spokes have poorer access to tertiary education.

These results reinforce the fact that regional hubs provide their hinterlands with access to tertiary
education training services.
Again, data shows that the hubs with better access to tertiary education, have spokes with higher
average scores. For example, Table 2 shows big regional cities have poorer hub scores (4.8) and
they have the poorest average hinterland scores (6.9), this is in comparison to the smaller cities
which sore an average 3.6 in the hub and 5.0 in the hinterland.
Tertiary education access highlights an important point of the significance of regional city size. The
second largest hubs (Big regional cities) include Ballarat, Bendigo, Mackay, Toowoomba and
Geelong, all have population over 100,000 people and less than 250,000 and yet on 2011 data
they have lower average access to tertiary education than some of the smaller cities like Albany
(37,000 people).
However, there is a large spread of the hub and spoke scores, Figure 4 identifies that as a
regional city hub improves its access (score closer to 1), the hinterland spokes have in general, a
spread of about 5 deciles (i.e. 50 per cent).

Financial services hub and spoke network
RCA member regional cities also have a clear role in providing financial services to their
hinterlands. Access to financial services is seen as a crucial ingredient for regional economic
development through two ways. First these services, e.g. bankers, accountants, loan managers etc.
stimulate small business creation and deliver a vibrant local business ecosystem that drives internal
local economic growth. Second is that they provide the necessary services to drive growth in other
local businesses like farms, manufacturing etc. ensuring that locals get the best advice to grow local
jobs and output.
Table 2 summarizes the RCA member hub cities, their average financial service access scores and
the average score for their spokes. Evidence offers two new findings:
•
•

Most regional city hubs have better access to financial services (i.e. closer to one) than their
hinterlands.
Financial services are more evenly spread across the different size and remoteness of
regional city hubs than tertiary education and health services.

The biggest hub, Central Coast, does not do particularly well on access to financial services
(ranking the national middle of 5, see Table 2) and with its hinterland including Sydney and
Newcastle – this hub does worse than its hinterland spokes, which average in the top 30 per cent of
the nation.
However, after this anomaly, access to financial services broadly follows the same pattern as
health and tertiary education, the smaller the hub the lower the ranking (i.e. moving from 2.5 to 3.1
decile). Corresponding the lower the hub average the lower the spoke average (moving from 5.1
to 5.6 deciles). Again, the group of big regional cities provides lower than expected findings in
relation to access to financial services.
While larger centres do get slightly higher scores, there is clearly a more even spread of access to
financial services across size and remoteness. For example, hubs gaining a top score of 1 in both
centres and small cities include Wodonga and Bunbury.
Figure 5 shows that remoteness of city hubs has an interesting impact on hub scores with the two
major cities (Geelong and Gosford) receiving much poorer access to financial services (i.e. higher
scores) than inner and outer regional. This can be explained by these cities relative co-location with
capital cities, which dominate and supply financial services from Melbourne and Sydney to service
these Major City hubs.
While Wodonga and Bunbury, both inner regional hubs for remoteness, have a larger spread of
scores in their hinterlands, for Wodonga (which includes Albury and Wangaratta as spokes) is 5.3
while for Bunbury the average spoke score (includes Capel, Busselton etc.) is 7.6.
Importantly, regional hubs and spokes do well for access to financial services. There is a smaller
range in hub scores across the different population and remoteness categories, and this is
especially noticeable when compared to the broader spread of scores found in health and
education. This indicates that health and education are more centralised in the larger hubs, while
financial services is more decentralised across all regional cities in the hub and spoke network.

Network for regional economic growth
It is now established that Australia has many networks that stretch across its wide brown land.
Some, such as the National Land and Transport Network (focused on infrastructure of road and rail)
are recognised as important to Australia’s economic development and have coordinated efforts in
delivery to achieve economic efficiencies.
Other networks, based on functional connections, include job provision and service access. These
networks are not currently acknowledged and as such have no national recognition of importance
or coordination.
Evidence from Europe points to the potential substantial economic development benefits that can
accrue from efficient networks, such as stimulating regional development, stronger economic growth,
enhanced labour productivity and a more resilient economy. To deliver these benefits in Australia,
investment into the regional city hub and hinterland spoke network on functional, as well as
structural, connections is necessary.
The evidence has shown that currently the hubs and spokes network has weaknesses in delivering
service access to small and remote hubs, especially for tertiary education and health. This has a
flow on effect to very poor scores for hinterlands, which surround these hubs. Investment to target
these hubs and their hinterland spokes could have significant impact on the local economic growth
potential.

Key hubs and spokes messages
Australia has an awakening recognition of its regional city hubs and hinterland spokes.
With proper recognition and targeted investment, Australia’s hub and spoke network of regional
cities and hinterlands could deliver more local jobs, increased economic output for the nation and
more efficient access of services to regional areas. Ensuring similar benefits from network
investment in Australia, as found in Europe.
Key findings on the role of RCA member cities to the city and hinterland network for jobs and
access to health services, financial services and tertiary education are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Regional cities act as job creating and service access hubs to rural hinterlands.
Regional cities and rural hinterlands form a hub and spoke network that connects across
Australia.
Bigger hubs (e.g. regional cities with more population) have generally higher access scores
to health services, tertiary education and financial services than hinterland spokes.
Size is not the clear determinant of city roles. Small cities can have high access to health,
tertiary education and financial services – if they are more remote e.g. Geraldton in WA,
as opposed to Horsham, Vic.
There is a clear drop off from city hubs to rural LGA spokes in more remote areas (e.g.
Cairns to Cassowary Coast from 3 to 7 in health access deciles).
Level of service to surrounding spokes from a hub is also related to how densely
populated the region is and how isolated the spoke is, highlighting that some cities have
different functional roles than a focus only on size would indicate.

This initial work has highlighted a range of insights that taking a hubs and spokes network
approach to regional economic development in Australia can have for policy makers, local leaders
and delivery agents. Specifically it has started the discussion on how to deliver regional economic
development most effectively, when accounting for the relationships between all settlements types
in Australia, metropolitan, regional capital and hinterland.

Further Information
Method and data
This work considers four functional networks; job provision, health access, tertiary education and
financial services for the RCA members.
Focusing on Australia’s regional capitals (Local Government Area members of Regional Capitals
Australia), we use journey to work data and census data from 2011 to test the hubs and spokes
networks. Thirty one regional capitals are currently members of the RCA.
Using LGA data to estimate access to each of these services a proxy was established. Proxies are
based on 2011 census data from the RAI [In]sight dataset and include:
•
•
•

Health services, proportion of population with allied health qualifications.
Tertiary education services, proportion of people engaged in university education.
Financial services, proportion of people employed in financial roles.

To understand the relationship between hubs and spokes a number of important groupings were
made. First is the type of hub and spoke. Across Australia there is no universal categorisation
system for hubs and spokes, therefore we developed one based on population size of LGA, which
aligns to international standards and ABS categories (Table 1). We find the RCA members are split
across four hub categories, metropolis, big cities, centres and small cities. In addition we also used
the Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) which also has four categories; major
cities, inner regional, outer regional and remote
Second, each proxy was compared to the rest of Australia through the [In]Sight ranking index. To
simplify the results, deciles are reported, where decile rank of 1 is the top 10 per cent of LGAs
and decile rank of 10 is the bottom 10 per cent of LGAs across Australia. With 563 LGAs in
Australia.
