Geology
The Cowal gold deposits (E41, E42, E46, Galway, and Regal) occur within the 40km long by 15km wide
Ordovician Lake Cowal Volcanic Complex, east of the Gilmore Fault Zone within the eastern portion of the
Lachlan Fold Belt. The overall structure of the gold deposits is complex but in general consists of a faulted
antiform that plunges shallowly to the north-northeast. The deposits are aligned along a north-south orientated
corridor with bounding faults, the Booberoi Fault on the western side and the Reflector Fault on the eastern side
(the Gold Corridor).
The E41 West mineralisation strikes north-northeast and dips -70° east, and measures 750m along strike and
250m across strike. Individual mineralised zones are 35m to 50m wide and extend down dip for 125m. The E41
East mineralisation strikes east-west and dips -35° to -80° south, and measures 475m along strike and 500m
across strike. Individual mineralised zones are 35m to 50m wide and extend down dip for 225m.
The E42 deposit comprises the Regal/Galway corridor and the E42 Main Zone. The Regal/Galway corridor
trends north-south, dips vertical to -70° west, and is composed of small and discontinuous lenses. The corridor is
approximately 900m along strike and 200m wide. The E42 Main Zone trends north-south and dips -35° to -45°
west. The two principal domains in the E42 Zone are separated by the Cowal Fault. Overall, the E42 Main Zone
mineralisation is approximately 850m by 850m and extends 500m down dip.
The E46 deposit is subdivided into the East and West zones. The East zone is a continuation of the
Regal/Galway corridor, trends north-south, dips vertical to -70° west, and extends approximately 750m along
strike and 175m across strike. Individual lenses in the E46 East mineralised zone are 1.0m to 15m wide, 25m to
250m long, and extend 50m to 200m down dip. The E46 West mineralisation trends north-northeast, dips -40°
west to flat-lying, and measures approximately 650m along strike and 17m across strike. Individual zones are
approximately 50m wide and extend 200m down dip.

ASX Announcement

17 October 2016
ACQUISITION OF MARSDEN COPPER-GOLD PROJECT

Evolution Mining Limited (ASX:EVN) (“Evolution”) advises that it has entered into a binding agreement with
Newcrest Operations Limited (“Newcrest”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Newcrest Mining Limited to acquire
the Marsden copper-gold project. Evolution will make an upfront payment of A$3 million on completion of the
1
acquisition and a further A$7 million payment contingent on a decision to mine . The agreement is subject to
conditions including governmental approval.
Marsden is a copper-gold porphyry deposit located immediately to the south-east of Evolution’s Cowal gold
mine in New South Wales. Marsden is the nearest known sizeable mineral deposit to the Cowal operation
outside the Cowal tenement package and as such has strategic value to Evolution’s exploration activities in
the region.
The Marsden deposit hosts an Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource of 180 million tonnes grading 0.20g/t
2
Au and 0.38% Cu containing 1.1 million ounces of gold and 0.67 million tonnes of copper .
Technical review by Evolution has shown that the potential to develop the Marsden deposit is enhanced by
utilising the Cowal milling circuit and associated infrastructure. The current Cowal treatment facility is unable
to treat Marsden material concurrently with Cowal ore and hence any option involving processing at Cowal
will be at the end of the Cowal mine life.
Commenting on the Marsden acquisition, Jake Klein, Executive Chairman of Evolution said:
“The Marsden project provides long term optionality to our nearby Cowal operation and has
the potential to further extend the life of what is already a long-life operation.”

Local jobs secured after Cowal Gold Mine extension approved
Local jobs at the Cowal Gold Mine near West Wyalong in the state’s Central West
have been secured after the Department of Planning and Environment approved a
modification application to increase production and extend the life of the mine for an
extra eight years.
The modification will deepen the existing open cut pit to access additional gold
resources. There will be no additional development above ground at the mine site as
a result of this modification. Conditions managing water use at the existing site and
separating the mine from surrounding water resources, including Lake Cowal,
remain the same.
Clay Preshaw, Director of Resource Assessments, said the Department considers all
applications on their merits under planning legislation and clear NSW Government
policies.
“Currently, the mine employs 385 people and stimulates economic activity in the
local and regional economy,” Mr Preshaw said.
“These jobs and economic advantages are now secured with the approval of the
modification application, which will see the existing mine increase its total extraction
from 3.8 to 5.5 million ounces of gold over an extra eight years until 2032.
“Updates to the existing open cut pit, mine waste storage facilities and the on-site
processing plant will also take place as a result of the approval.
“The Department has also strengthened the noise conditions to provide additional
safeguards for the local community.
Evolution Mining’s application was publicly exhibited by the Department between
November and December to encourage community feedback. All 65 public
submissions received by the Department were in support of extending the mine and
its related economic benefits for the local area.

COWAL AWARDED NSW MINING OPERATION OF THE YEAR
Evolution Mining Limited (“Evolution”) is pleased to advise its Cowal Gold Operation (“Cowal”) was the proud
recipient of the NSW Mining Operation of the Year Award at the NSW Mining Industry and Suppliers’ Awards on
Thursday, 6 April 2017.
Cowal was recognised for its outstanding performance in 2016 on a number of fronts. The operation exceeded
its planned production targets in 2016 while also completing an ambitious exploration program which included
more than 39,000m of drilling. The exploration program supported the Modification 13 submission to the NSW
Department of Planning and Environment (“DPE”) for the proposed mine life extension of the operation. A total
of 65 positive submissions were made during the public consultation process and strong support was received
from the Bland, Forbes and Lachlan Shires. The modification has since been approved by the DPE and
investment in an eight year mine life extension to 2032 has been approved by the Board of Evolution.
During 2016, the region around Cowal experienced a record flood event that affected local towns and farms,
isolating workers and restricting mine supplies. Cowal successfully managed through this event and was actively
involved in flood mitigation and relief work in communities in the region.
Commenting on the Award, Evolution’s Executive Chairman, Jake Klein, said:
“I had the honour of collecting the Award which was a wonderful recognition of the incredible work our people at
Cowal have achieved over the past year. What a thrill it was for me to be able to share the moment with some of
our colleagues from Cowal, along with Katrina Hodgkinson, Member of Parliament for the seat of Cootamundra
in which our Cowal mine is located, and Jeff Stien who was there representing the Bland Shire.
“The event is about celebrating the people and businesses that make NSW Mining strong and acknowledging the
communities in which we operate that are pivotal to any mining company’s strength and success. The Award
would not have been possible without the support of the Bland, Lachlan and Forbes Shires.”
Representatives of the mining industry and supplier businesses from across NSW joined with the Deputy Premier,
the Minister for Resources and 22 other NSW Members of Parliament at the Dinner. NSW Minister for Resources,
Energy, Utilities and the Arts, The Hon Don Harwin MLC delivered the keynote address, focusing on the
importance of mining in fostering the growth and strength of regional communities.

MAG SURVEY REVEALS LARGE COPPER-GOLD TARGET AT WEST WYALONG

HIGHLIGHTS:
■

Airborne magnetic survey reveals large magnetic low anomaly in Ordovician volcanics spanning
a significant area of approximately 1.4 km x 0.8 km

■

Magnetic anomaly is coincident with an IP chargeability anomaly identified by MIMDAS survey

■

Strong copper and gold geochemistry intersected above the anomaly by historical shallow
aircore drilling (anomaly remains untested)

■

Porphyry copper gold target indicated - similarities to the Northparkes system observed

■

Argent has now earned a 51% interest in the West Wyalong Project, right to earn 70% now active

WEST WYALONG, NSW AUSTRALIA
Argent Minerals Limited (ASX: ARD, Argent, Argent Minerals or the
Company) is pleased to announce the results of an airborne magnetic
survey conducted at the West Wyalong Project in NSW, Australia, a farmin
joint venture between Argent Minerals and Golden Cross Resources in
which Argent Minerals has the right to earn a 51% interest, then 70%,
through exploration expenditure.
The West Wyalong Project is situated in the Macquarie Arc of the Lachlan
Orogen, in a geological setting of Ordovician volcanics which hosts worldclass porphyry copper-gold mines such as Newcrest's Cadia, China
Molybdenum's Northparkes, and 37 kilometres to the north of West
Wyalong - Barrick Gold's Lake Cowal mine.
The purpose of the West Wyalong survey was to obtain enhanced magnetic geophysics data over an area of
interest which Argent had recently identified as being potentially prospective for a porphyry copper-gold deposit. In
2013 the Company had identified the potential deposit by reprocessing historical geophysics data that had been
obtained from low resolution government magnetic and radiometric surveys.
The high resolution magnetic data from this recent survey has enabled Argent to significantly advance
interpretation of the subsurface geology and the definition of areas where the magnetic minerals in the host rock
may have been altered by mineralisation processes. The survey has successfully identified an area of low magnetic
rocks within a belt of predominantly magnetic high response, indicating thermal destruction of magnetism typically
associated with volcanic intrusion processes. The much higher resolution of the new data at 50 metre line spacing
has enabled 3D modeling of the anomaly, and correlation with induced polarisation (IP) data reprocessed from a
historical Mount Isa Mines Distributed Acquisition System (MIMDAS) survey.
The co-location of the magnetic anomaly with an IP chargeability high anomaly, and the strong copper-gold
geochemistry intercepted above it by shallow air core drilling, together confirm a sizeable potential porphyry
copper-gold target. The interpreted dimensions of the magnetic anomaly are significant, being approximately 1.4
kilometres in the north-south direction, 800 metres from east to west, and extending to depth from 200 metres.
Managing Director David Busch said, "This is a very exciting development for the West Wyalong Project, placing it
on the map as a sizeable Australian porphyry copper-gold target, in which Argent has earned a 51% interest. If it is
connected to the same structure as our Narragudgil Prospect 2 kilometres to the south east as we believe it to be,
then we may have identified the potential for a major discovery in this rich, fertile area which has produced some of
Australia's best copper-gold deposits".

The airborne magnetic survey data was obtained by Thompson Aviation Limited using latest technology equipment
with the sensitivity and accuracy to measure changes in the earth's magnetic field as small as 1 part in 5 million.
The survey was flown at 35 metres above ground in a pattern of parallel lines spaced 50 metres apart for a total of
1,574 kilometres. Details of the equipment employed are set out in JORC 2012 Table 1 Section in Appendix B of
this announcement.
The high resolution of the magnetic survey data, a first for this area, enabled ARCTAN Services Pty Ltd (ARCTAN)
to perform a detailed analysis and to produce a 3D interpreted model of the magnetic anomaly. An interpreted
cross section is presented in Figure 2a, with inverted colours for ease of reference in the context of thermal
destruction of magnetic properties. Amongst other possible interpretations, the section presented in Figure 2a is
consistent with known porphyry copper-gold mineralisation (eg. Northparkes) in this geological terrane.
The interpreted dimensions of the magnetic anomaly are significant, being approximately 1.4 kilometres in the
north-south direction, 800 metres from east to west, and extending to depth from 200 metres.

About the IP chargeability anomaly and the co-incidence with the magnetic anomaly
Comparison of the new magnetic data with chargeability data from a historical 100 metre pole-dipole MIMDAS
survey reveals a coincidence of the magnetic low with an area of elevated IP chargeability (see Figure 1b - plan
view, and Figure 2b - the corresponding cross section). Originally obtained during 2002-2003, the MIMDAS survey
data was re-processed by ARCTAN as part of this analysis, for comparison with the magnetic survey data; a 3D
interpreted model has also been produced from the MIMDAS data and a cross section set out in Figure 2b for
side-by-side comparison with the magnetic anomaly.
The coincident IP chargeability anomaly is indicative of porphyry copper-gold mineralisation in this geological
setting. The IP chargeability anomaly indicates a potential pyritic halo typically surrounding mineralisation in a
porphyry deposit. Coincidence of the magnetic low and the IP chargeability high is a strong indication of alteration
associated with intrusions related to porphyry copper-gold style mineralisation.
Further modelling and interpretation of the IP and high resolution magnetic data indicates that the anomaly plunges
to the north and continues to depth.
About the shallow drilling - strong geochemistry provides additional confirmation
Shallow aircore drilling conducted by Newcrest Mining in January 2000 intersected strong gold and copper
geochemistry, providing additional confirmation of the porphyry copper-gold signature.
Intercepts above the magnetic anomaly include gold from 0.05 g/t to 0.24 g/t, and copper to 645 ppm, which are
considered to be strong geochemical anomalies in the context of shallow aircore drilling. As can be seen by the
cross sections in Figures 2a and 2b, the holes are considered as not having tested either of the magnetic or IP
chargeability anomalies.
It is important to note that the shallow Newcrest drilling was performed prior to the MIMDAS survey conducted
during the 2002-2003 period. The shallow aircore drilling was performed by Newcrest in 2000 as part of a broad
grid-based geochemical mapping exercise which extended across a much larger area.
Only the relevant Newcrest drill holes are shown on Figures 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b, out of a much larger drillhole
population. The Newcrest shallow drilling did not target what we now know to be a strong magnetic anomaly in
the area, and the company's historical exploration reports make no mention of any magnetic anomalies.
Had the exploration company known about the coincident magnetic and IP chargeability anomalies in the area,
there would have been a strong case for drilling much deeper holes. However, since the anomalies were not
identified, and the company's strategy was to perform broad grid-based shallow aircore drilling, the depths of the
holes were limited.
Please refer to Appendix A, Table A for details of the Newcrest shallow aircore drilling.
About the geological setting and the airborne magnetic survey area
The West Wyalong Project is situated in the Macquarie Arc of the Lachlan Orogen, in a geological setting of
Ordovician volcanics which hosts world-class porphyry copper-gold mines such as Newcrest's Cadia, China
Molybdenum's Northparkes, and 37 kilometres to the north of West Wyalong - Barrick Gold's Lake Cowal mine.
Exploration licence EL5915 and the southern portion of EL8001 of the West Wyalong Project are strategically
located on the Narragudgil Volcanics, in between the Gilmore Suture, a major crustal structure, and the Yiddah
Formation (Figure 3). Copper-gold porphyry deposits commonly occur in orogenic belts at convergent plate
boundaries and are often associated with oceanic volcanic island arcs overlying oceanic crust such as the
Macquarie Arc. Ordovician age Narragudgil Volcanics are prospective for porphyry copper-gold deposits. These
deposits are typically medium to large tonnage (30 to >300 Mt) with grades ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 g/t gold and
0.2 to 1.5% copper.
Argent Minerals has now earned a 51% interest in this project whose key prospects are the magnetic anomaly
featured in this announcement, and the Narragudgil Prospect located approximately 2 kilometres to the south
east. Given the north-west trend of the structures, there is a possibility that these two prospects are connected
beneath overlying cover.

Similarities have been observed in relation to the Northparkes deposit, and will be reported separately to the ASX
on completion of the analysis.
Next steps
Argent has determined that the anomalies are to be tested as a priority.
Prior to drill testing of this anomaly, the area of the magnetic low will be surveyed with more closely spaced deeply
penetrating IP, such as a 100 metre by 200 metre offset pole-dipole survey. The model generated from such a
survey would be more accurate in terms of defining the strongest IP chargeability response to aid precision
drillhole planning.

Sampling
techniques

Argent Minerals is reporting a new airborne magnetic and radiometric survey conducted in June 2014 and
interpretation conducted in conjunction with historical MIMDAS survey conducted by MIMEX (Mouth Isa
Mines Exploration) in 2002 and Aircore drilling conducted by Newcrest Mining in January 2000.
Airborne Magnetics June 2014
Argent Minerals contracted Thomson Aviation Pty. Ltd. Was to carry out an airborne magnetic survey at
Argent Minerals/Golden Cross Operations Pty Ltd exploration licence EL5915 at West Wyalong. A total of
1754.4 line kilometres was surveyed. Equipment and sampling techniques employed in the survey are listed

MIMDAS (MIM Distributed Acquisition System)
MIMDAS (MIM Distributed Acquisition System) is a geophysical acquisition system developed by MIM
(Mouth Isa Mines). The system allows for concurrent acquisition of data from an (theoretically) unlimited
number of sensors. The current ‘normal’ configuration records magneto-telluric (MT) and pole-dipole induced
polarization (IP)/resistivity data. The system has been in operation since 1996 and is used routinely in Mt Isa
Mines Exploration (MIMEX) exploration programs. Implementation of remote referencing provided significant
improvements in signal to noise and development of 3D survey techniques. The system has superior depth of
investigation and data quality over conventional IP systems.
In total, 18 lines (for total 57.5 line km) of IP/MT MIMDAS were read over the West Wyalong project. The poledipole configuration with 100 m dipoles was used for both IP and MT. IP transmitter poles were offset 50 m in
order to negate the need to remove potential electrodes from the spread. Hence data were collected for
n=0.5, 1.5, 2.5 etc to the maximum possible for each line. IP/ resistivity data were recorded using a sampling
rate of 200 samples per second. Transmitter frequency was 25/256 Hz. Fifty percent duty cycle time domain
responses were calculated from the frequency domain responses incorporating a 15 point Hanning window
moving average filter. Data were stacked over 13 periods. Chargeability calculations were normalized to the
average decay voltage divided by the average ‘primary’ voltage for the entire charge and decay periods. An
integration period of 1.8 to 2.4 seconds was used. Units are millivolts per volt (mV/V).
The MIMDAS survey for EL5915 was the first in NSW to use remote-reference telluric cancellation. The
method proved very effective with significantly improved signal to noise and clean, useable data being
collected from below significant depths (~100m) of conductive (<10 ohm-m, largely due to saline
groundwater) material.
‘Telluric corrected’ data were used for all inversion modelling. Data were inverted using Zonge Engineering’s
TS2DIP 2D inversion program.

MT time-series data were recorded at 1600 samples per second. This sample rate generally provided valid
apparent resistivity and phase data over a frequency range from 400 Hz to about 0.04 Hz. An electric field
dipole (100m) orientated normal to the survey line and two pairs of orthogonal magnetometers provided Ey,
Hx, and Hy data. MT data quality was very good. Data were inverted using OCCAM software.
Aircore drilling – Newcrest Limited January 2000
The air core holes were drilled through cover and saprolite rock until refusal of fresh rock. Entire drill hole
length (except transported aeolian/alluvial soil) was sampled. Drill chips samples were submitted to ALS
Laboratory in Orange. Samples were crushed to 6mm and then pulverized to 75 microns. A 25 g split of the
sample was fire assayed for gold. The lower detection limit for gold is 0.01 ppm, which has been determined
to be an appropriate detection level. Other elements including Cu, Pb, Zn, As and Mo were analysed using
acid digest and either an Inductively Coupled Laser - with technique IC581.
Drilling
techniques

The aircore drilling was conducted by Newcrest in January 2000 is assumed to use conventional methods
with a standard 140 mm hammer size (5.5 inch).

Drill sample
recovery

Based on the historical records the sample recovery is assumed to be satisfactory.

Logging

Geological logging recorded lithology, weathering/alteration, mineralisation and veining.
Logging was both qualitative (discretional) and quantitative (volume percent).
The holes are geologically, geochemically logged hundred per cent (100%).

Sub-sampling
techniques
and sample
separation

Drill chips samples were split using a riffle splitter or speared (not clear from historical reports) in calico bags
each up to 2.5 kg weight composited on 2 metre intervals.

Quality of
assay data
and laboratory
tests

Quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) procedures for historical sampling, assay data and laboratory
tests is not reported in detail. However, it is assumed that Newcrest Mining conducted it to the highest
industry standards in operation at the time. In addition, Newcrest repeated assays of every anomalous gold
result.
No geophysical tools or handheld XRF instruments were used in assaying procedure.
In summary, the net result of all the laboratory techniques and procedures applied are considered to have
been high quality in nature and appropriate for mineral exploration results reporting.

Verification of
sampling and
assaying

Airborne magnetics
Verification of airborne magnetic data had been initially conducted by Thomson Aviation Pty Ltd and by
ARCTAN Services Pty. Ltd. (Steve Collins) and Argent Minerals personnel.
MIMDAS survey
The data quality was very good according to MIM geophysical report. Data verification and processing was
conducted by MIM geophysicist D. L. Webb. In addition, in 2012 Argent Minerals contracted ARCTAN
Services Pty Ltd (Steve Collins) to conduct a review and inversion of this data and create 3D
chargeability/resistivity model.
Aircore drilling
Aircore drilling assays were verified by Newcrest geologist Fraser Mac Corgoudale and Golden Cross
geologist Gordon McLean. In addition, assays results also were verified by Argent Minerals personnel – Dr.
Vladimir David.

Information

During 2001 and 2002, exploration work carried out by Newcrest Operations under a joint venture
agreement with Golden Cross Operation in the Narragudgil (south-eastern portion) area included:
-­‐

90 x Air Core drill holes for 7838.4 metres at the Narragudgil prospect ;

-­‐

10 x RCP holes for 1822.5 metres at Yiddah prospect; and

-­‐

8 x combined Air Core/Diamond core holes for 1224 metres of air core, and 824.5 metres
diamond core.

•

Initial work carried out by MIMEX in 2002 included a compilation of historic drill results, review of
existing core, mapping, reconnaissance ground magnetics, and MIMDAS surveys. A total of 57.5
line km of MIMDAS IP/MT were surveyed on 19 lines and five RC percussion holes for a total of
834m were drilled to test anomalous areas. The MIMDAS geophysical IP/resistivity, magnetotelluric
system was used in the pole-dipole configuration with 100 dipoles. MIMEX withdrew its interest in
the joint venture in June 2003.

•

Reviews by Argent Minerals of past exploration including drilling, surface geochemistry and
geophysical surveys highlighted two prospects: Narragudgil and Yiddah North Prospects, both
directed towards porphyry style base metals (Cu-Au) in the Narragudgil Volcanics. These prospects
are located in the south-eastern portion of the EL 5195 tenement area. A wide zone (400m) of
principally propylitic alteration was identified during the drilling, extending in a north westerly
direction for around 3km through the licence area.

Argent Minerals exploration strategy at West Wyalong primarily focuses on the targeting of porphyry style CuAu systems hosted in Ordovician arc rocks, as well as orogenic / structurally controlled quartz vein hosted
gold deposits. The occurrences of major epithermal (Cowal), porphyry (Marsden, Yiddah and Gidginbung)
and intrusion related (Hobbs, Adelong) deposits provide encouragement that large intrusion/volcanic-related
hydrothermal systems may exist in this part of the Lachlan Orogen. This, in addition to the discoveries at
Cadia, near Orange, and Northparkes, near Parkes, show that Ordovician age magmatic arc complexes in
New South Wales are highly prospective for Cu-Au porphyries and associated epithermal deposits

Kempfield polymetallic project – 100% Argent
Following the recent diamond drilling programme at
Kempfield which established significant depth
extensions to the known deposit, an updated
resources estimate will be prepared to incorporate
extensions beyond the historical shallow drilling limit
of approximately 120 metres on which the current
Kempfield mineral resource estimate is based. Key
inputs to the updated resource estimate will include
data from a proposed infill drilling programme and a
metallurgical test programme.
The metallurgical test programme has commenced
for Kempfield, where the silver/lead/zinc recovery
potential of primary rock material will be tested in a
standard flotation processing environment.
Mr. Roland Nice has been appointed to oversee the

100 projects in 26 different countries. These include the Cowal project for Barrick Gold Corporation, Cadia
Ridgeway and Telfer for Newcrest Resources, Prominent Hill for Oxiana (now Oz Minerals), Jaguar (taken over by
by Independence Group), Mt. Lyell for Copper Mines of Tasmania, Thalanga (acquired by Red River Resources),
the Voisey’s Bay nickel Hydromet Project for CVRD, Olympic Dam for Western Mining Corporation (taken over by
BHP), and most recently, the Woodlawn base metals project in NSW for Herron Resources.
Historical metallurgical testing was primarily focused on a first stage mining scenario where silver and gold would
be firstly extracted by leaching processes from the oxide/transitional and primary material, followed by silver and
base metals extraction by flotation of the leach residues. The oxide/transitional material extends from surface to
approximately 40 metres. Below this, the primary (unoxidised) material is located, containing the lead and zinc
1
components of the Kempfield resource in addition to silver and gold .
Given the potentially substantial increase in base and precious metal resources resulting from the depth
extensions, the new metallurgical test programme will focus on optimising the extraction of silver, lead and zinc
from primary material as separate concentrates by a standalone flotation process. A primary material composite of
approximately 50 – 100 kilograms will be constructed from representative samples that will be selected and cut
from existing Kempfield drillcore. The composite will be divided into smaller samples for a series of metallurgical
tests that will be devised and supervised by Mr. Roland Nice.
The results of the testing will provide additional data for the assessment of the equivalence formulae and cutoff
grades for the Kempfield resource re-estimate.
The results will also provide additional data for a concept-level reassessment of Kempfield economics that will
follow the updated resource re-estimate.
Preparations for the Kempfield resource infill drilling programme are underway. H&S Consultants Pty Ltd (H&SC)
has updated the Kempfield drilling database that it employs for the resource estimation. Following an initial review
in Micromine, formal QAQC checks will be conducted by H&SC, and an exploration targeting model developed.
This will incorporate the Company’s latest geological model to provide a basis for efficient resource infill drill
planning by Argent.
Approximately 5,000 metres of reverse circulation (RC) drilling is envisaged, with infilling of the identified immediate
lateral and depth extensions to the deposit as the first priority.
West Wyalong porphyry copper gold project – 70% Argent
The West Wyalong drillcore processing is ahead of schedule, with the detailed core logging completed, and five of
the six holes submitted for assay. The five holes already submitted comprise all of the drill test holes for the Theia
target.
The core samples from the remaining sixth hole AWN001, which tested the Narragudgil target, are expected to be
submitted early next week.
The laboratory has advised Argent to expect delays because of a significant increase in assay volumes, with assay
results being available within a timeframe of up to five weeks from receipt of the samples. In response to the
nationally increased workloads, the laboratory has also advised that is it in the process of progressively upgrading
its processing capacity to a 7 day per week operation.
In total, more than 80% of the total drill core will have been submitted by Argent for assay. This significant
percentage of drill core has been selected on the basis of visual observations during the drillcore logging process.
Following the Company increasing its ownership of the West Wyalong project to 70%, a formal joint venture is now
in place under the West Wyalong Farmin and Joint Venture Agreement, whereby the Company’s 30% partner will
either contribute their share of exploration expenditure or be diluted.

Loch Lilly drill programme – earning 51% by testing for Western Tasmania Mt. Read Volcanics potential
In preparation for the upcoming Loch Lilly drill programme, the Company has executed all land access
arrangements with the relevant landholders, allowing the drill sites to be inspected and photographed, and
applications to drill submitted to the NSW Department of Planning and Environment for approval. All other
regulatory authorities have also been notified as required.
Subject to a timely drilling approval by the NSW Government, Argent has currently scheduled drill site preparations
to commence during the last week of June 2017, and the drilling to commence during the first half of July 2017.
The drilling phase of the Loch Lilly test programme is anticipated to take approximately three weeks, subject to
operational conditions and weather. This will be followed by Argent’s standard process of detailed core logging
and selection of samples for submission for assay.
Research undertaken by Argent’s joint venture partner, Dr. Anthony J. Crawford, has indicated that a geological
belt, which extends from western Tasmania to western Victoria and eastern South Australia before swinging
northeast and into western NSW, includes rocks equivalent to western Tasmania’s Mt. Read Volcanics, with
potentially major discovery implications for the Loch Lilly - Kars Belt in NSW.
Over a strike distance of just 80 kilometres, the Mt. Read Volcanics of western Tasmania hosts several world-class
base and precious metal deposits, including Mt. Lyell, Rosebery and Hellyer, and numerous medium-sized
deposits, including the Que River and Hercules volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) copper-lead-zinc
deposits, and the Henty gold deposit.
Two compelling targets will be tested at Loch Lilly - Eaglehawk and Netley, which were identified by Anglo
American’s South American division in 2014 through a new magnetic - induced polarisation (IP) survey tool. Anglo
American (Australia) Pty Ltd then partnered with Dr. Crawford in early 2015 to drill test the targets, but was
instructed later that year by its head office to terminate all base metal exploration projects in Australia as part of a
global restructuring effort.
By completing the two-hole 1,000 metre Loch Lilly drill programme comprising one 500 metre diamond hole for
each target, Argent will earn a 51% interest in the project.
Under the Loch Lilly joint venture agreement executed between Dr. Crawford and Argent, the Company has the
2
right to earn up to a 90% interest in the project, which has a combined exploration licence area of 1,447 km that
covers the majority of the Loch Lilly - Kars Belt.
The direct per-metre drilling costs of the Loch Lilly drill test programme are 75% co-funded by the NSW
Government to a maximum of $150,000.
All three of Argent’s projects have been awarded NSW Government Cooperative Drilling funding grants, based on
project prospectivity and technical merit as assessed by independent expert panels appointed by the NSW
Government.

ASX Release
23 June 2015

Drilling completed at the Bygoo tin project
Thomson Resources is pleased to announce that first phase drilling has been completed
on its Bygoo tin project near Ardlethan, NSW. Ardlethan is the biggest tin deposit in NSW
and is recorded to have produced 25,000 tonnes of tin in concentrate from open cut and
underground operations between 1964 and 1986. Bygoo North has similar geology to
Ardlethan and limited historic drilling has shown good potential for an economic tin
deposit.
10 holes for 1060m were drilled to confirm historic drill intersections and extend the
mineralisation by testing along strike and at depth. Mineralisation was logged in in 9 of
the 10 holes: both greisen type alteration as well as discrete quartz veins. 227 samples
from individual metres have been submitted for laboratory assay. Results are expected
in early July.

Further Outstanding Drill Results at Bygoo Tin
•

Exceptional intercepts up to 11m at 2.1% Sn at Bygoo North

•

Main greisen zone confirmed: open to east, west, and down dip

• New discovery – strong intersection at Bygoo South – 8m at 1.3% Sn
Thomson Resources is pleased to announce drilling results from its third round of
drilling at the Bygoo tin project near the Ardlethan tin mine, NSW. Five drill holes,
including one diamond hole, were drilled to test the newly discovered tin-bearing
greisens at Bygoo North as defined in drilling during 2015. In addition, three holes
tested the Bygoo South prospect located 400m south of Bygoo North.
High grade tin intersections of similar tenor to those previously recorded were
obtained at Bygoo North. The standout intersections are as follows –
•
•
•
•
•

11m at 2.1% Sn from 78m depth (BNRC20)
8m at 1.7% Sn from 121m depth (BNRC19)
4m at 2.4% Sn from 97m depth (BNRC18)
9m at 0.7% Sn from 141m depth ((BNRC19)
3m at 0.5% Sn from 65m depth (BNRC20)

Drilling at the new Bygoo South Prospect recorded a high grade intersection
down-dip from old workings • 8m at 1.3% Sn from 57m depth (BNRC21)
Bygoo North
Thomson targeted the latest round of drilling to firm the interpreted model of the
high grade tin mineralisation and establish the true widths of the greisen zones.
The standout intercept from the 2015 drill program was 35m at 2.1% Sn in
BNRC11, which was modeled to be largely “down-dip” or oblique to the trend of
the mineralisation (TMZ ASX Release dated 21 Oct 2015). A new hole, BNRC20,
drilled in the opposite direction to BNRC11 (Figure 1) and intersected the same
steeply north-dipping quartz-topaz greisen, at the same grade of 2.1% tin over a

downhole length of 11m. The true width of the mineralised zone is interpreted to
be between 8 and 12m (BNRC20 also intersected a weaker zone higher up the
hole which may be included in the overall greisen zone).
The zone is open at depth and extends east-west at least 100m in strike – but is
open in both directions and down-dip (Figures 2 and 3).

Figure 1: Bygoo North sectional view showing comparison between BNRC11 which drilled a
greisen of 35m in downhole extent versus the better orientated recent hole BNRC which drilled
an 11m width. Both had a 2.1% tin grade over these widths.

As part of the work program, accurate (“differential”) GPS topographic data was
collected, including the location of some old Cominco drill collars (1974-1977).
Analysis indicated that the historic drill collars have previously been positioned

incorrectly, 35m to the northeast of their true location, which, when re-plotted, has
resulted in the generation of a much simpler and more consistent E-W oriented
corridor of mineralisation located entirely within the Ardlethan Granite (Figure 2).

Several intercepts, however still plot outside the main zone, including a recent
hole (the lower, northern intercept in BNRC13). There is a strong possibility that
these intercepts represent greisens of as yet to be determined strike and dip, and
more drilling is required.
A further drill program is planned to define and extend the central greisen and
target those high grade intersections that lie outside the main zone.
Bygoo South
Three holes were drilled at a new prospect – Bygoo South, 400m south of the
Bygoo North area. This prospect is at the site of a historic underground mine
which operated between 1932 and 1946 for a reported production of just over
10,000 tonnes of ore at 0.8% Sn (Department of Mines Mineral Resources Report
No. 20). The prospect had previously been drilled in 1974 with three holes that
were located too far north and south of the mine to be effective.
Thomson’s drilling program was based on a cross section of the workings
published from 1939 (Mines Record no. 2594 – Figure 4). The drilling proved
successful with an 8m intersection grading 1.3% Sn from 57m hole depth
(BNRC021), down-dip from the workings. This intersection is highly encouraging
as it defines a new area of high grade mineralisation close to Bygoo North and
indicates that additional zones of tin mineralisation may be defined further to the
south towards the Ardlethan tin mine with the fertile Ardlethan granite. This
prospect clearly demands further drill testing.

Sampling techniques

Commentary
1m intervals were bagged as they were returned from
drilling. A three tier hand held riffle splitter was then used
to procure laboratory samples in calico bags.

Drilling techniques

Holes were all collared and drilled reverse circulation (RC), with
the exception of BNRCD16 which had a diamond tail from 67m
Drilling was carried out by Australian Mineral & Waterwell Drilling
Pty Ltd.

Drill sample recovery

Recoveries are estimated at 60-100%. Diamond recovery was
95-100%.
All holes were logged for geology.

Logging
Sub-sampling techniques
and sample preparation

No sub-sampling was carried out.

Quality of assay data and
laboratory tests

Duplicates and standards were submitted along with the samples.
Initial assessment indicates good quality. Samples were dried
and pulverized to <75 microns at SGS laboratories in West
Wyalong and dispatched for assay to SGS laboratories at Perth
Airport. The assay method was XRF78S, where the samples are
fused to a glass bead using a lithium metaborate/tetraborate flux
and irradiated by XRF.

Verification of sampling and
assaying

Samples were assayed for several other elements besides tin –
Copper (significant intercepts of 6m at 0.4% Cu in BNRC016 at
62m depth and 3m at 0.3% Cu from 65m in BNRC020) and
Bismuth (7m at 0.1% Bi from 117m in BNRC019).
Loss On Ignition values varied between 0.4% to
6.7% with an average of 1.6%.
No independent verification has been carried out.

Location of data points

Drill hole location was by Differential GPS; errors are less than
0.5m.

Data spacing and
distribution

The data spacing is irregular.

Orientation of data in
relation to structure

All holes were drilled at a 60 degree dip testing a model of steeply
dipping veins and greisen.

Sample security

No particular security measures were taken.

Audits or reviews

No independent audit or review undertaken as this was not
thought to be required at this stage.

ASX Release
17 March 2017

Bygoo Farm-in Update
Thomson Resources is pleased to update shareholders with progress at the Bygoo Tin
Project in central NSW.
As announced to the ASX on 21 November 2016, Riverston Tin PL (a wholly owned
subsidiary of Thomson) signed a Farm-in and Joint Venture Agreement for its Bygoo Tin
Project in central New South Wales with a North American investor (BeiSur OstBarat
Agency Ltd – “BeiSur”). BeiSur has granted an option to Rheingold Exploration Corp., a
public company listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE:RGE), to acquire the
rights to the agreement.
Under the amended agreement Rheingold can earn a 51% interest by contributing $A3
million in a series of staged payments by 30 November 2017. Rheingold then has an
option to contribute additional $A22 million to earn a further 25% interest, which is
exercisable until 1 October, 2018.
The assignment to Rheingold is subject to Canadian Securities Exchange approval and
completion by Rheingold of financing raising gross proceeds of not less than $C1 million.
The payment schedule of the remaining funds to Riverston for exploration at the Bygoo tin
project is listed as follows within the amended agreement:
•

AUD$580,000 within 5 business days of satisfaction of the Conditions

•

AUD$800,000 on or before July 31, 2017; and

•

AUD$1,500,000 on or before January 31, 2018

(For the full announcement by Rheingold see the Canadian Securities Exchange at

To date, Thomson has received $A120,000 as part of a series of staged payments to
reach the $A3 million earn-in, but the preparation of an Independent Expert Report and
regulatory processes in satisfaction of Canadian requirements, have resulted in delays to
receiving CSE approvals and the balance of cash payments. This in turn, resulted in the
delay of the processing of tin assays from the December 2016 round of Bygoo drilling
(announcement dated 8 December 2016).
Thomson is confident that significant funding payments and assay results from Bygoo will
be received shortly ahead of a new round of exploration drilling scheduled for the next
quarter.

Summary of study findings
This study provides estimates of the direct and indirect cost of the closure of the Newell Highway
between 23 September and 4 November 2016.
The total direct gross cost from the national perspective is estimated at $CVM112 million1. The $CVM
price year is 2014-15.
The components of the cost include:
(i)

$23.5 million for increased road freight transport costs;

(ii)

from the national perspective it has been assumed that there is no loss in tourism
expenditures. However, for the LGAs most impacted by the closure this is estimated at $ CVM14
million;

(iii)

$CVM16 million from the loss of nearby service exports from the LGAs in the broader Bland
Creek catchment;

(iv)

loss of agriculture production of $CVM20 million, compared to the case of an upgraded highway
with best practice drainage facilities;

(v)

loss of production of $46 million from supply chain disruption elsewhere in Australia; and

(vi)

$6.7 million from increased road maintenance expenditure.

The total impact in terms of lost total gross regional product (GRP), in terms of the flow-on impact
for lost increases and household consumption expenditure on the economy, is modelled at minimum
$CVM138 million, up to $CVM153 million and the loss of two million hours of work with the contribution
of some loss of employment, but most likely under-employment, of a conservative 5194 workers.
The loss of GRP in the LGAs most impacted on within the Bland Creek Catchment was of the order of
a conservative $CVM36 million.
In terms of the LGAs within the catchment, the majority of the catchment cost is attributed to Bland
and Forbes.
This study could not have been done without the invaluable assistance from Bland Shire Council and
feedback from the local community, business and government organisations in the Bland Catchment
region and the National freight companies that provided detailed information on the impact of the
Newell Highway closure on their operations. NSW Transport: Roads and Marine Services also
provided important comments.

The direct and indirect cost of the Newell Highway closure
The study objective is to quantify the direct and indirect economic costs of the flooding in the Bland
Creek catchment which led to the closure of the Newell Highway between West Wyalong and Forbes.
The road was closed on 23 September 2016 and reopened on 4 November 2016. A total of 43 days.
However, the study assumes a 44 day closure to allow for lags in the adjustment of behaviour. This
estimate is conservative. The effective impact on truck routes may well have occurred before
23 September while the lagged adjustment to the road opening would have been certainly greater
than one day.
Hereinafter the event is referred to as the ‘road closure’.

Study information sources

The information sources on which this report was based were:
■

community and LGA consultation;

■

survey of freight transport organisations;

■

Tourism Research Australia data series; and

■

the NIEIR LGA data base.

The survey of freight transport organisations involved nine organisations. These organisations
provided, on a strictly confidential basis, detailed information of freight transport economics along
the Newell catchment area and the impact on the economics due to the road closure.
As will be seen below, Tourism Research Australia data was also an important input. However, the
data had to be seasonally adjusted and greatly filtered to remove underlying instability caused by
small sample sizes for some of the SA2 regions. For most of the Bland Creek Catchment LGAs the
tourism data for the last two quarters of 2016 was in accordance with community assessment. This
was not the case for West Wyalong which was assumed to follow the same outcome as the Forbes
SA2 adjusted from community assessment feedback.

2.

The Bland Creek Catchment

The Newell Highway was closed because of flooding in the Bland Creek catchment shown in Figure 1.
The Bland Creek in central New South Wales rises near Twins Range (elevation 390m) around 15kms
west of Cootamundra. It drops around 185m over its 173km length, where it eventually flows into
Lake Cowal (elevation 208m).
The following seven creeks flow into the Bland Creek: Berthong, Rushy, Meedallion, Bribbaree,
Narraburra, Burrangong, and Barmedman Creeks.
The Bland Creek Catchment, which covers an approximate area of 940,950 hectares, has been
divided into six sub-catchments: Barmedman, Burrangong/Tyagong, Caragabal, Lower Burrangong,
Narraburra/Duck Creek, and Upper Bland.

The regional segmentation

The data is generally applied at the Local Government Area (LGA) level. The tourism data is obtained
at the SA2 level and then aggregated into LGAs when an LGA has two or more SA2s.
Figure 2 shows the LGAs in the wider Bland Creek Catchment. For the purposes of this report the
narrow catchment consists of the LGAs of Bland, Cabonne, Cowra, Forbes, Parkes, Temora and
Weddin.

The heavy vehicle diversion impact

The assumption of this report is that one way 400 heavy vehicles per day were diverted to either the
official diversion route or via Sydney or Broken Hill.
From Table 2, the October 2016 data showed 56 heavy vehicles per day southbound on the Newell
Highway between Forbes and West Wyalong compared to 439 per day for October 2015. Presumable
this would also capture trucks using part of the closed Highway for east-west routes. Therefore, the
key estimate of this report that there was a diversion of 400 heavy vehicles per day southbound. This
estimate can also be justified on the grounds that there is likely to have been an underlying growth in
trucks using the Newell between October 2015 and October 2016 and/or alternatively includes a
small estimate for smaller vehicles that were also been diverted. On the assumption of the same
number of diversions northbound giving a total reduction of 800 heavy vehicles trips in both
directions. This is probably a conservative estimate, NSW Transport: Roads and marine services in
correspondence to NIEIR estimated the reduction as 880 heavy vehicles or ten percent more than
what has been allowed for in this report.
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) shows the “official” diversion route although the data in Table 1 indicates the
route via Sydney was perhaps the more important alternative. Figure 4 shows the role of the Newell
Highway in the East Coast road freight transport task. There was also a diversion of heavy vehicles
via Broken Hill to South Australia. Heavy vehicles travelling from Adelaide to Sydney and or Brisbane
via the Mid Western Highways were also diverted to alternate routes via Broken Hill or Sydney.

The impact of the road closure on the road freight transport
industry: The survey results

The long haul core routes impacted by the flooding were Brisbane-Melbourne, Brisbane-Adelaide
and Adelaide-Sydney routes which would also include the freight to and from Tasmania. Minor
routes impacted would have been the connections of centres in South Australia and Victoria and
centres North of the flood area in New South Wales and Queensland and vice versa. The impact of
the flooding however would be similar for nearly all routes and therefore can be quantified in terms
of the impact on two core routes.
In order to accurately assess the impact of the closure a data base of all the possible routes would
have to be developed and the number of vehicles diverted from the new highway to these routes
estimated. A weighted average estimate would then be calculated. In the absence this information
the freight companies were approached to provide to this study a weighted average estimate in their
view of the impact of the closure. That is the organisations which know the “weighted average”
impact were approached for the necessary information.
The answer back from these organisations was that the average additional kilometres for costing
purposes will be based on 275 additional kilometres. This was a strong response in that the standard
deviation of the company responses from the mean was small.

This does not mean that technically shorter options were not available. For example new or was used
then the appropriate diversion would be the Dubbo-Cowra-Temora diversion a distance of 110 km.
Some of the diversions via Sydney would also have added less than 275 km. The freight companies
went to great pains to stress that the weighted average impact incorporated many factors. Some
routes were not employed because of inferior roads resulting in greater wear and tear on trucks and
increased travel times. Even if the shorter routes were employed the freight companies took this into
account by estimating the travel length equivalent which captured the increased costs. The same is
true of diversion routes via Sydney where the increased congestion costs of higher truck running
cross per kilometre and increased travel times from congestion were also taken into account by
deriving a weighted average effective travel distance to version.
The B-double is the largest vehicle allowed on the Newell Highway with a maximum load of 36
tonnes and higher for other vehicle types. The average load from the freight company survey is
approximately 33 tonnes though back fill loads will in general be considerable less. Hence the 20
tonne average per trip in Table 4.
The average fuel efficiency of a loaded B-double is 1.6 to 1.8 kilometres per litre. However all survey
respondents noted that fuel efficiency would have declined because of the flooding due to:
■

more hills for the alternative routes East of the Newell Highway;

■

to reach maximum fuel efficiency standards driver specialise in routes. The flooding forced
drivers into unfamiliar routes.

Therefore a fuel efficiency average standard of 1.6 kilometres is adopted for this report.
The average extra time for a trip was placed by the survey respondents at between three and five
hours. The Sydney diversion incurred additional time delays from congestion. The average extra time
adopted in this report is, therefore, four hours.
Given the survey information and cost data from other sources the cost of the road closure on the
road freight industry is developed in Table 4. The costings are self-explanatory except for the
opportunity cost component. The survey respondents stressed the costs of events where late arrival
resulted in loss of delivery slots forcing an overnight wait in waiting for a new slot. In this case the
substitute costs to cover other committed tasks is assumed to be the full daily costs of a heavy
vehicle.

The extra kilometres will impose additional maintenance costs on the New South Wales road system.
The road system cost is taken from Phillip Laird, “Freight transport cost recovery in Australia”,
University of Wollongong, Research and Online, 2006.
The estimate updated to $CVM is 0.017 per tonne kilometre. That is the 2006 estimate has been
updated to current costs using the appropriate cost indexes. The total number of tonne kilometres
imposed on the road system because of the road closure is 198 million, giving a total road recovery
cost of $CVM3.3 million. However, because trucks were forced onto less suitable roads the cost is
increased to $CVM6.7 million. This estimate represents a very conservative additional cost to councils
as of trucks using inappropriate local roads. Local councils viewed these costs as considerable. Thus
when the road authorities receive the estimates of the total cost of repairing roads from the Newell
Highway closure they are likely to find that the costs are considerably greater.
The additional costs are assumed to be levied on New South Wales households on a uniform per
capita basis.

Overnight tourism: Narrow Bland Creek Catchment

The starting point for the impact of overnight tourism is the NIEIR estimates of the export of
accommodation services for both domestic and international visitors for the LGAs in the narrow
Bland Creek Catchment. For the LGAs in the narrow Bland Creek Catchment the average quarterly
estimates, in $CVM million, for 2015-16 are:

Cabonne
Cowra
Forbes
Parkes
Temora
Weddin

2.9
2.8
9.1
6.1

Next, to this estimate is applied the ratio of other tourism related expenditures (food. Fuel etc.)
compared to the accommodation expenditures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, “Tourism
Statistics Accounts” for 2015-16 are applied to the LGA accommodation export estimates.
The Tourism Research Australia data series is then used, after adjustment as outlined above, to
estimate the impact on overnight tourism for the December quarter 2016 as a result of the road
closure. The Parkes estimate is based on information supplied by the Local Authority.
The results are given in Table 5.

The loss of exports

Goods exports, whether international or domestic, are unlikely to involve a permanent loss of
exports. In the worst case it can be stockpiled until an opportunity arises for delivery. The exception
to this is where late delivery causes permanent production losses in downstream supply chains or at
the very least permanent loss of sales for the late delivered product. This case is addressed in
Section 10 below.

Hence, the focus here is on mainly service exports from an LGA to a nearby LGA. Difficulties in
obtaining services are likely to result in a change in scheduling or the cancellation of the service.
Table 6 shows the level of inter-regional exports for 2016 for the LGAs in the wider Bland Creek
catchment. Thus, the rate of inter-regional exports from the Bland LGA is $CVM0.9 million per day.
The next step is to extract from the inter-regional exports from an LGA those exports where the
delivery route would be significantly disrupted by the road closure. For Bland LGA, this would involve
those exports which would have been delivered along the closed section of the Newell Highway.
That is, LGAs to the north of Forbes LGA. These estimates are shown in the second column of Table 6.
For Bland the result is a net export level of $CVM0.3 million per day.
The next step is to obtain a realistic adjustment factor which, when applied to column two in Table 6,
that would deliver a plausible estimate of the loss in exports and in particular the export of services.
A guide to appropriate adjustment factor can be obtained from Tourism Research Australia’s
estimates of expenditures at distinction of trip expenditures. For Forbes this revealed a drop of
expenditures for the December 2016 quarter of $3.2 million. For Cowra a decline in expenditure
compared to the same quarter a year earlier of $1.0 million. For Parkes the decline in day trip
expenditure was $1.3 million. The actual loss of export estimates in column three of Table 6 are
derived on the assumption that, for those LGAs where the daily trip expenditure is reliable, the actual
export loss will at least equal the daily trip expenditure chain, but would most likely be greater. For
the other LGAs the same relativities are maintained for the ratio of actual export losses to potential
export losses.

The highway impact on agricultural costs

An allowance is made from the claims that the current highway design aggravates the flood damage
on agriculture. The reasoning is that lack of suitable drainage infrastructure increases the height of
the flood in certain locations. An up graded highway with suitable drainage facilities would reduce
the flood damage. That is, reduce the losses in agriculture. The savings are set at 5 per cent of
agriculture production in Bland, Weddin and Forbes. This comes to a total cost of $CVM20 million.
Certainly the community feedback from the farmers who considered themselves directly impacted
from increased flooding from the current Newell highway design considered the cost to them to be
considerable. Whether or not this proves to be the case can only be assessed by the appropriate
detailed and extensive hydrology studies. Comments on the draft by the Parkes Shire Council, inter
alia, included:
The report also shows that the road closure as a result of the flood bore no impact on
agriculture in Parkes Shire (Table 8). However in speaking with industry leaders, that is not the
case and the closure did in fact negatively impact the agricultural sector significantly through
various means including:


Inability to conduct southern grain movements to local buyers.



Other local infrastructure was impacted by the Newell closure (particularly the ParkesEugowra Road) with increased traffic making wide-load and regular machinery
movements difficult due to traffic volume and damage to road edges and narrowing of
roads.



Inability to have critical supplies delivered from regional agricultural suppliers resulting
in timeliness costs and reduced competition at a critical point of the season where there
was a narrow window for applications due to the weather and crop stage.



Increased time for delivery of spare parts from the south at a critical point of the season
resulting in production downtime.



Deliveries of triticale to dairies were impacted as Parkes district farmers require the
Newell Highway for B-double access to the farm to service farms at Eugowra.



Cash flow was significantly impacted in local farming operations as grains were held over
for long periods until roads were re-opened and transport operators had B-Double truck
availability following long hold-ups.

This is an important comment because it can be used to clarify the status of the agriculture sector in
this report. The comments are of course accurate and indisputable. But are not directly appropriate
to this report. The reason is that this report is not about flood damage per se but about those current
design features of the Newell Highway that contributed to additional flooding costs that could
otherwise been avoided with a better Highway design. This restricts the focus to those properties
linked to the Bland Creek Catchment. The indirect cost of the relevant $CVM20 million damage on
Parkes will be captured through the modelling evaluation framework.

The cost of supply chain disruption

Community consultations indicated that there was likely to be not insignificant supply chain
disruption in Australia because of the road closure. That is, production losses because of the late
delivery of imports.
From Table 4, the estimate of the value of freight diverted over the period of the road closure was
$CVM4.3 billion. The supply chain disruption cost is estimated at $CVM46 million based on the
assumption of 5 per cent of the value of freight diverted would have involved some supply chain
disruption costs and the value of supply chain imports from the freight diverted would have
impacted 50 per cent of the value of the supply chain output. Feedback from those freight
companies willing to provide investment considered the 5 per cent benchmark is reasonable.

11.

The modelling framework

In order to access the impact of the direct costs on the economy of the road closure a regional
econometric model is required. This modelling framework is based on NIEIR’s Local Government Area
(LGA) based inter-regional input-output model of the Australian economy. Each of the 567 LGAs has
its own input-output sub-model at the 86 industry 2-digit level. The industries are defined in the
attached table. Each industry in a given LGA is linked to the same industry in any other LGA by a 567
by 567 inter-regional trade flow matrix.
Previous multiplier analysis using the model used behavioural functions in the model for household
consumption expenditures, hours demanded, etc. This study imposes the structure of the economy
as prevailing exactly at 2016 on the model so that the multiplier results are closer to the “pure”
textbook input-output inter-regional multipliers. That is, the following parameter settings are
imposed on the model for 2016:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
(vii)

the prevailing consumption to disposable income ratio by LGA;
consumption expenditure share at 2-digit ANZSIC industry by LGA;
hours demanded per $m of output by 2-digit ANZSIC industry by LGA;
employment in numbers demanded for 1,000 hours worked by 2-digit ANZSIC industry by LGA;
$/hour by 2-digit ANZSIC industry by LGA;
International imports per $m of demand by 2-digit ANZSIC industry by LGA; and
The inter-regional trade flow matrix fixed at average 2015 values by 2-digit industries by 567
LGAs.

The data base has been updated to the September quarter 2016. With a further partial update to
March quarter 2017 for the 2017-18 NIEIR/ALGA “State of the Regions” report of June 2018.

12.

The flow-on macroeconomic implications

Using the modelling framework outlined above, Table 7 shows the impact on the regional economic
aggregates with a national loss in gross product of $CVM138 million. In the main the employment loss
would represent under-employment rather than outright loss of employment.
Table 8 shows the impact on industry output at the 2-digit ANZSIC level for the narrow Bland Creek
Catchment LGAs. The total loss of the value of production is $CVM74 million. However, this estimate
includes double counting with the net cost measured by the decline in gross regional product of
$CVM36 million.
The degree of uncertainty will vary across the various cost segments. Some are “hard”, that is, have
a small degree of uncertainty, while for others it would take considerable cost to finalise estimates.
In this context, the costs that have been left out, in order to compensate for the degree of
uncertainty surrounding some of the costs which have been included, should be noted. These
include:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

the disruption to intra LGA economic activity has not been fully captured in the costs;
the costs of the Newell Highway repair, which would be avoided if the Highway was upgraded;
and
the disruption to regional freight routes because of limits on heavy truck usage on alternative
routes and, therefore, the fact that freight had to be either cancelled or delayed.

Newell Highway closure: Unaccounted costs

No account has been taken of intra LGA costs of the Newell highway closure. That is the cost to local
businesses and residents of the inability of local workers to reach their places of employment or local
residents to reach local businesses in terms retail and service expenditures. This is likely to impose a
significant conservative estimate to the costs of the flooding event. The impact of intra LGAs and
accessing normal services such as doctors, dentists, chemists, family and friends and emergency
services. In addition the inter LGA export estimate appear conservative compared to the community
feedback.
Accordingly an additional $15m has been included as a contingency cost bring the total direct and
indirect cost to $CVM0.153 billion

Newell Highway closure: Preliminary cost benefit

Cost benefit analysis of the level of Newell Highway upgrade costs to avoid or mitigate the impact of
flooding that can be justified will be carried out by those best equipped for this task. However, some
high level benefit numbers can be readily obtained from this analysis.
On the assumption that:
(i)

climate change results in a 1 in 20 year flood becoming a 1 in 15 year flood;

(ii)

on average every seven years there are minor flood events occurring to at half the cost of the
2016 event; and

(iii)

the growth in Newell Highway heavy vehicle traffic equals the real discount rate.

Then on the assumption that over a 50 years of the life of a Newell Highway upgrade that rendered
the road flood-proof the discount net economic benefit would sum to five times the 2016 national
economic costs, or $CVM0.8 billion. The next step would be to commission the Bureau of Meteorology
to endorse or change these assumptions.
The next step in relation to validating or changing these costs would be for the appropriate transport
authorities to estimate the impact of the proposed inland rail you route between Brisbane and
Melbourne in terms of mitigating the costs of the closure of the Newell highway from future flood
events.
However the most important next step would be to commission a study of what can be done to
mitigate flooding damage generally in the Bland Creek catchment and how much the capital cost of
these strategies would in effect also involve flood proofing the Newell highway. If future flood
proofing of the region could be justified on economic grounds and a significant element of that was
the upgrading of the Newell Highway then the benefits assessed in this report (less the flood damage
costs) in cost-benefit terms would only have to be compared to the additional costs of flood proofing
the Newell highway. That is those costs over and above the capital cost of changing the Newell
highway design to mitigate regional flood damage costs.
The Newell Highway has been flooded and or closed between West Wyalong and Forbes in 1950,
1952, 1956, 1962, 1974, 1983, 1990 for twelve weeks, and 2012 and in 2016 for six weeks.
It could well prove that these costs are relatively small compared to the benefits (that is avoided
costs) assessed for the national impact of avoiding Newell Highway closure from future flood events.
