Attachment A
Pensioner Concession Inequities - Water and Sewer
Background
There has been a long history of inequities of pensioner rebates for water and sewer
between customers in the city and those of other service providers in regional NSW.
The Council Rebate for water and sewer is a fixed concession for eligible pensioners jointly
funded by the NSW State Government and local councils. The rebate a pensioner in an
area not serviced by Sydney Water or Hunter Water is based on the following as contained
within the Local Government Act:
•

50% of a water charge up to a maximum $87.50 concession.

•

50% of a sewerage charge up to a maximum $87.50 concession.

So an eligible pensioner in these areas can receive a maximum of $175 off their total water
and sewer charges.
These maximum available concessions have been in place for many years, without any
adjustments. Therefore, as water and sewerage bills have increased in real terms over time,
pensioner rebates decline in value relative to the total water and sewerage bills.
Councils contribute 45% of these concession costs, through lost income to the water and
sewer funds.
The pensioner rebates for eligible Sydney Water customers are calculated in a different way
and are far greater. Those rebates are 100% of the water access charge and 83% of the
sewer access charge. Comparing the charges for Sydney Water pensioners and pensioners
served by a selection of other local water utilities for 2015/16 are given in the table below.

Attachment A
It has been assumed that the additional pensioner concessions for Sydney Water are funded
from their business, and has a direct impact on their bottom line, similar to any other LWU
that wishes to provide additional pensioner concessions. However, the pensioner rebates
for Sydney Water are not funded from the Sydney Water business but are fully funded by
the State government (see Appendix A for the accounting details). Analysis of the source
of such a significant discrepancy leads to an inevitable conclusion that the NSW State
Government has been subsidising pensioners in Sydney Water’s area of operations with a
disregard to pensioners residing in regional areas that are served by local councils and other
LWUs.
It is difficult to trace back the source of such a discrepancy, but it is clearly not an initiative
of the current government and has a long history.
An extract from the 2008 IPART Sydney Water determination: “Review of prices for Sydney
Water Corporation’s water, sewerage, stormwater and other services” - June 2008 Final
Report gives some explanation of the methodology of the Sydney concessions and IPART’s
thinking on this matter:
“IPART considers that customer-impact mitigation is primarily the responsibility of the
Government as part of its broader social policy. IPART recommends that the Government
evaluates the current suite of social programs, along with the enhancements proposed by
Sydney Water in its initial submission, to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to
assist financially disadvantaged customers………………………
In recent correspondence, Sydney Water advised that it proposes to seek increases in the
sewerage pensioner rebate (currently 83 per cent of the sewerage quarterly service
charge) to keep pensioner bill increases proportionally in line with those of nonpensioners.
This means that if the average annual water and sewerage bill for a non-pensioner
increases from $752 (in 2007/08) to $997 (in 2011/12), the average pensioner’s annual bill
will rise from $347 (in 2007/08) to $460 (in 2011/12) – an increase of 33 per cent (in real
terms) for both bills. This requires the sewerage service rebate to increase to 84.6 per cent
of sewerage service charges from 2009/10 onwards to equalise the increase across the
four years.
If these rebates are used for other consumption levels (eg, 500kL per annum), the
relationship between non-pensioner and pensioner bills is not maintained. However,
IPART again notes that this program is a matter for Government policy.”
Council believes that:
Pensioner rebates for water supply and sewerage should be consistent irrespective
of whether the pensioner lives in the city or in a regional area.

Outcome sought:
The Government should evaluate this issue in the context of all its broader social
policies and implement modified measures to ensure that regional water supply
and sewerage customers who are eligible pensioners have the same rebates as
their city counterparts.

Attachment A
Appendix A - State Funding of Sydney Water Pensioner rebates
i)

Extract from the Sydney Water submission to IPART for the pricing path for the
2016-20 determination period:

“Sydney Water currently provides concessions on water, wastewater and stormwater drainage
service charges to recipients of the Centrelink Pensioner Concession Card and certain Department
of Veterans’ Affairs cards.
Through this scheme eligible home owner-occupiers (ie pensioners) currently receive a rebate of
100% on water, 83% on wastewater and 50% on stormwater service charges. The rebate costs are
recovered from NSW Treasury as a Community Service Obligation.
It is envisaged that the wastewater service rebate percentage for pensioners will change as a
result of the price reductions that we have proposed. Subject to the final prices determined by
IPART, Sydney Water will make the appropriate adjustments to the rebate percentage for
pensioners that will be in line with the principle that ensures pensioner bills are kept in parity with
non-pensioner bills, ie they increase/decrease by a similar percentage.”

Attachment B
Waste Levy
Shoalhaven is designated as “metropolitan” by NSW State Government and hence pays the
highest waste levy allowable. This cost is actually met by the “consumers” of waste services
i.e. the ratepayers, residents and businesses of Shoalhaven. It is already established that
Shoalhaven residents are economically “disadvantaged” in comparison to other regions.
The Waste Levy for Shoalhaven City Council is $138.20 per tonne.
compounded when you examine the category of adjoining councils:

The inequity is

•

Eurobodalla Shire Council - Waste Levy N/A
(Eurobodalla is immediately south of Shoalhaven)

•

Kiama Municipal Council - Metropolitan Waste Levy $138.20 per tonne
(North of Shoalhaven)

•

Wollondilly Shire Council - Regional Waste Levy $79.60 per tonne
(Northwest of Shoalhaven)

The category of councils is specified in Section 7 of the Protection of the Environment
Operations (Waste) Regulation 2014.
http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/your-environment/waste/waste-levy
https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2014/666/part2
Council contends that an inequity exists within NSW as different parts of the State (i.e.
residents) are levied varying amounts.
Shoalhaven residents contribute over $10 Million to the State Government whereas
Eurobodalla residents contribute nil.
The recent ‘Energy from Waste’ technology inquiry has recommended at Recommendation
3:
“That the NSW Government reclassify Shoalhaven City Council from the Metropolitan Levy
Area to either the Regional Levy Area or the Unregulated Area”.
https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/committees/inquiries/Pages/inquirydetails.aspx?pk=2436#tab-reports
At this time there has been no government response.
Outcome sought:
That the State Government reclassify Shoalhaven City to the Unregulated Area.
This will save residents, ratepayers and the businesses of the Shoalhaven over
$10 Million per annum.

Attachment C
Public Transport (Employment, Training, Medical)
The lack of regular and affordable public transport systems in regional and rural areas
compared to metropolitan areas is a major inhibitor and creates inequities related to:
•

Inability for youth to travel to town centres for employment.
compounds high youth unemployment rates in our region.

•

Inability for youth to travel to access training opportunities, particularly TAFE &
University. In many circumstances to gain access to courses for apprenticeships it
requires travel to either Sydney or Wollongong. Besides a lack of reliable and
connecting public transport systems it also requires additional expense of overnight
or weekly accommodation.

•

Inability for aged and/or disabled community to access medical services that is only
provided in larger regional centres or capital cities.
This demographic is
disadvantaged and in some situations individuals simply do not seek out the medical
services they actually need because it is too hard.

This in particular

Outcome sought:
That regional and rural areas receive adequate services and subsidy to allow
equal opportunity to access necessary education, employment and medical
services.
