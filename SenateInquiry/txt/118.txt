EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Regional Inequality and Challenges to Townsville’s Growth
Regional inequality is a significant constraint on national development. In particular, it is being driven by the
shift from resource (agriculture, mining, and manufacturing) to service industries. This shift has profound
geographic consequences with the loss of jobs most acutely experienced in regional centres like Townsville
and North Queensland. Skilled service jobs are in high demand, but these cluster in capital cities.
A further contributing factor to regional decline is energy affordability. This is due in significant part to
successive Australian and state governments failing to balance competing priorities of competition, security,
reliability and emissions targets, without adequate regard to the impacts on affordability and business
viability. Like energy, significantly higher cost of household and business insurance in North Queensland is also
creating regional inequality and cost of living pressures for Townsville residents.
Townsville is being impacted by synchronised cyclical (mining) and structural (manufacturing) industry decline.
These forces underlie deterioration in confidence, investment, employment, income and growth. This is
compounded by federal Government fiscal decisions impacting the level of Australian Public Service
employment within the city. The subsequent economic and demographic effects are cause for government
intervention that will mitigate the economic and social impacts and enable the region, its industries and
residents, to adjust effectively and take advantage of new opportunities arising from the Indo-Pacific region.

Current Policy Responses – Townsville City Deal
In December 2016, the Commonwealth, Queensland Government and Townsville City Council enacted
Australia's first City Deal. The Townsville City Deal is a 15-year commitment focused on improving the lives of
Townsville residents through job creation, economic growth, investment in local infrastructure, a revitalised
urban centre, and a more vibrant and liveable city. It provides an approach for government to work together
to deliver transformative outcomes for Townsville.
The Townsville City Deal is in its second year of implementation. While Townsville City Council is encouraged
with progress made in establishing the deal, further work needs to be done to drive outcomes under the deal.
The level of funding commitment and practical implementation to drive investment, particularly at the federal
level, has been disappointing.
Given the economic climate and the commitment provided under the City Deal, Townsville is very
disappointed with the 2018/19 Federal budget. The city received no additional funding and was not specifically
included in any capital works initiatives. Nothing was delivered under the City Deal.
Townsville City Council looks forward to working with the Federal Government to address the impacts of
inequality in North Queensland. Recommended initiatives and actions to progress this process include:

Introduction

Over 150 years Townsville has grown from a small private port to the largest city in Northern Australia.
We survived depressions and recessions, natural disasters, droughts and World Wars and have grown to be
home to metal refineries, universities, the largest tertiary hospital outside a capital city and 200,000 of our
nation’s most resourceful and resilient people.
Since 2013, Townsville has been hit with several economic shocks that have seen our economy and community
suffer. These shocks have been significantly exacerbated and hampered in their recovery by government
policy, regulation and political processes.
Our city is experiencing increasing social disadvantage, compounded by significantly higher than average
business and households cost, particular for energy, insurance and transport services. With more than 21 per
cent of Townsville residents falling within the most disadvantaged quartile, households are having increasing
difficulty in meeting high cost-of-living expenses. Australia’s welfare and taxation systems need to better
recognise and address systemic regional inequalities.
Central to Townsville’s transition is the structural shift from manufacturing and agriculture to an economy
dominated by services. As a metalliferous manufacturing hub, located on the doorstep of the world’s largest
base metals minerals province, Townsville has lost both jobs and confidence as we redefine our place in the
changing world of global trade.
Economic opportunities and government funding are not distributed equitably. The relative decline of
agriculture, manufacturing and mining is having a profound impact on regional Australia. Skilled service jobs
are in high demand and tend to cluster in capital cities. Regional Australia is voting with its feet through its
increasing support for minor parties. The message is clear and its time we listened.
With our links to the north’s natural wealth and beauty, and proximity to the increasingly prosperous IndoPacific, no region is better placed to take advantage of Australia’s resources and global opportunities than
Townsville North Queensland.
We are young, capable and enthusiastic and we are proven in our ability to contribute more than our share.
Most importantly we want to partner with our federal and state colleagues to reach our potential in a world of
opportunity.
The Townsville City Deal, with its focus on the growth and investment needed to create a more vibrant and
liveable city, provides the foundation to this partnership. The Townsville City Council looks forward to working
with its state and federal partners to deliver real outcomes for the city and its residents.
Townsville was disappointed with the recent federal budget. Despite obvious economic and social need, the
city received no new or additional federal funding or support. It is difficult to reconcile this against the City
Deal’s principles of breaking down barriers to secure economic success for the city and its people.
This submission offers a revealing look at Townsville’s current socioeconomic environment and provides a
current and real example of inequality in regional Australia. It should be a catalyst for change in federal-local
relations.
We thank you for your consideration and look forward to working with the Federal Senate to address
inequality and disadvantage in regional Australia.

Townsville Situation Analysis

1

There is broad consensus that, post mining boom, Australia’s “next economic wave” will be derived from:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Agribusiness
Tourism
International Education
Gas
Health Services
Financial Services (banking, wealth management, insurance etc.)

Demand for these services will be driven by increasing prosperity throughout the Indo-Pacific region and the
tropics generally. This area accounts for more than 50 percent of global population and 60 percent of the
world’s children. Most live in poor but rapidly improving economic circumstances.
Townsville and the North Queensland region has strategic connections to Agribusiness and Tourism and
competitive advantages in International Education and Health Services. It is well connected logistically to the
Indo-Pacific region.
Figure 4: Townsville Strategic Location

With direct links to mining, agriculture and
tourism, no region is better placed to take
advantage of Australia’s natural resources
and global trade opportunities than
Townsville North Queensland.
The city’s estimated resident population of
th
193,946, makes it Australia’s 13 largest
major urban area behind Geelong,
th
Queensland’s 4 largest major urban area
behind the Sunshine Coast and the largest
city in Northern Australia.
Located approximately 1,200 kilometres
north of the State capital – Brisbane,
Townsville is Australia largest urban area,
not directly linked to its capital by
proximity.
Linkages, size and location provide the
Townsville North Queensland Region with a
diversity of economic drivers with no one
sector contributing more than 16 percent to
the economy.
As
outlined
previously,
Public
Administration and Safety is Townsville’s
largest industry sector.

Central to the public sector’s contribution’s is Defence. Home to more than 15,000 Defence personnel and
dependents, Townsville is regarded as Australia’s largest garrison city. The region hosts four major defence
establishments: Lavarack Barracks; RAAF Base Townsville; Townsville Field Training Area; and the Port of
Townsville’s Berth 10 (designed for the Royal Australian Navy).

Townsville’s growth and prosperity has been heavily influenced by government investment including:
•
•
•
•

the establishment of James Cook University, Australian Institute of Marine Science, the CSIRO and the
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in the 1960s and 1970s;
the establishment of Lavarack Barracks and RAAF Base Townsville in the 1960s and 1970s; the
Burdekin Dam construction in the 1980s;
the relocation and redevelopment of Townsville General Hospital as a tertiary teaching hospital; and,
the redevelopment of the Strand and Jezzine Barracks in the 1990s and 2000s.

After 16 years of continuous rapid growth, predominately driven by mining, manufacturing, health and
education, the Townsville North Queensland economy suffered a major recession (17.1 percent decline) in
2012. While nominally the region took almost three years to return to pre-recession levels, in real terms, it
took more than five years to recover, only returning to pre-recession levels of production in 2017.
Significant contributing factors to this downturn are a combination of market-driven changes (mining industry
demand shocks) and structural change, particularly within the manufacturing sector.
These economic factors are not unique to Townsville. The end of the mining investment boom significantly
impacted both Western Australia and Queensland, with regional centres such as the Pilbara, Mackay and
Townsville the most impacted. The decline in manufacturing is a national phenomenon, particularly impacting
regional centres.
Figure 6 outlines Australia’s sectoral share of employment for the period 1890 through to 2016. As in other
2
countries, Australians are spending a growing share of their income on services . The long-term trend
continued over the past two decades, with fewer working in agriculture and manufacturing and more working
in services. Since the mid-1980s, the share of jobs in agriculture has fallen from 6.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent
and in manufacturing from 16.1 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Townsville is highly exposed to these, particularly the
shift in manufacturing.

Contributing $942 million, or 5.9 percent of total value-added, Manufacturing is a long established and valued
sector within Townsville’s economy.
Critical to the sector is Townsville’s connection to mining and agriculture. Metals manufacturing contributes
$277.1 million (down from $365 million with the closure of the Yabulu Nickel Refinery). Chemical and plastics
manufacturing contributes $93 million. Transport equipment and parts manufacturing contributes $91.6
million and food products (Abattoir, bakeries etc.) manufacturing contributes ~$85.1 million annually.
It is estimated that Manufacturing employs 5,500 Townsville residents and contributes $531 million in salaries
and wages to the Townsville economy annually.
Townsville has three minerals refining/smelting facilities:
•
•
•

Queensland Nickel; nickel, cadmium and cobalt
Glencore Copper Refinery: copper cathode
Sun Metals: zinc, and sulphuric acid

These facilities use both local and imported product to produce high value-added goods traded on global
markets. They are significant contributors to Australia’s national accounts.
In January 2016, Queensland Nickels Yabulu Refinery was placed in administration. At the time, the refinery
employed approximately 780 people. In the two years leading up to the closure, a further 237 employees were
3
made redundant . It is estimated that the refinery’s closure resulted in the following impacts to the Townsville
North Queensland economy:
•
•
•
•

$1.1 billion in output (including $680 million directly and $400 million indirectly)
$220 million in Gross Regional Product per annum ( $40 million directly and $180 million indirectly)
$150 million in incomes and salaries paid to workers ( $70 million directly and $80 million indirectly)
1,970 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) jobs (including 780 directly and 1,190 indirectly)

The Glencore Copper Refinery is scheduled to close, potentially within the next five years. The Copper Refinery
directly employs approximately 400 people.

From a low of 4.1 percent recorded in the March Quarter 2013, Townsville’s unemployment rate more than
doubled (x 2.5) over the 4 years to record a 22 year high of 10.8 percent in March 2017. The significant
contributing factor was the closure of Queensland Nickel’s Yabulu Refinery in 2016. The downturn in mining
investment (from 2013) also significantly contributed to unemployment. Over the three quarters to December
2017, the unemployment rate declined to 8.2 percent, an outcome last seen in the March quarter of 2016.

From a high of 106,077 people recorded in the quarter ending 31 December 2011, Townsville’s labour force
trended down to 89,577 people in the quarter ending 30 December 2016 (loss of 16,500 or 15.5%). Since the
December quarter, Townsville’s labour force has recovered to reach 96,155 as at the December quarter 2017.
The combination of increasing unemployment and decreasing labour force participation suggests a level of
unemployment greater than the rate recorded with about 10,000 people giving up on employment or leaving
the city.

A significant contributing factor to regional industry decline is energy affordability with price increases over
the past ten years putting business and residential consumers under pressure. This is due in significant part to
successive Australian and state governments failing to balance competing priorities of competition, security,
reliability and emissions targets, without regard to the impacts on affordability and business viability. As is
evident in Figure 9, policy, regulatory and market decisions have led to dramatically higher prices.
Figure 9: Retail price index (inflation adjusted) – Australian capital cities

Source: ACCC Retail Electricity Inquiry Preliminary Report 2017.

These large price increases have not been matched across the economy or in wage growth. Figure 10 below
indicates that between 2007 and 2017, electricity prices had a compound annual growth rate of 8 per cent
which was more than twice that for wages (3.1 per cent) and triple the CPI rate (2.4 per cent) for the
corresponding period.

This situation is exacerbated in North Queensland due to our proximity to generation and subsequent reliance
on transmission. Since the introduction of a national electricity market, the delivered price of electricity in the
North has been up to 25% higher than comparable areas in the State. Significant factors contributing to higher
input costs include high transmission use of system (TUOS) and marginal loss factor (MLF) charges levied by
Energy Queensland (Powerlink). This significantly impacts the competitiveness of industry and is a major
disincentive to investment resulting in the loss of opportunity.

North Queensland’s largest industrial power user, Sun Metals, have noted that their power costs (around $5060M pa) have tripled over the last 15 years, and the additional cost associated with energy and its transmission
are impacting their competitiveness. Sun Metals has noted that if their plant had been in Gladstone rather
than Townsville they would save approximately $10.5M per annum on transmission charges alone.
Electricity prices have gone from a source of regional competitive advantage to a drain on business
productivity. Townsville, with its exposure to energy intensive metals processing and refining, is at the leading
edge of the shift from manufacturing to services. This is occurring however without recognition or structured
support from government to mitigate and facilitate the transition.
Outcomes in energy are similar to those experienced within other critical regional markets including insurance
and telecommunications.
Figure 11 outlines the relative size of Northern Australian home and content markets for 2016/17. As
illustrated, North Queensland makes up approximately 4 per cent of policies nationally, yet accounts for about
8 per cent of national premium revenue.

In 2016/17 the average annual home and contents insurance premium in North Queensland was
approximately $2,000, which is double the average premium reported for the rest of Australia at $1000 per
5
year. The average in premiums per sum insured (per $1,000 insured) illustrate even greater disparity at more
than double the rate for the rest of Australia.

For low income or vulnerable households, meeting increases in electricity and insurance costs often results
reducing expenditure on household basics like food, children’s educational needs or healthcare, or deferring
household repairs or basic transport costs.
The loss of high paying jobs in mining and manufacturing has had a marked impact on the level of social and
economic disadvantage experienced within Townsville. Figure 13 compares the relative socio-economic
disadvantage experienced over the inter-censual period 2011-2016.

The Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) focuses on low-income earners, relatively lower education
attainment, high unemployment and dwellings without motor vehicles. Low index values represent areas of
most disadvantage and high values represent areas of least disadvantage.
The impact is most evident in the changes in Quintile 1 (most disadvantaged) and Quintile 5 (least
disadvantaged). Residents within the most disadvantaged quintile (1) went from a below Queensland average
level of 13.4 percent in 2011 to an above Queensland average of 21.2 percent in 2016 (increase of 7.8% of the
population). Conversely, those within the least disadvantaged quintile (5) have gone from an above average
level of 23 percent in in 2011 to a below average level of 16.5 percent in 2016.
Based on 2016 census SEIFA estimates, 21.2 per cent of Townsville residents are in the most disadvantaged
quartile and at significant risk of having trouble in meeting high electricity and insurance costs.
High levels of disadvantage often translate to higher levels of criminality. Table 10 presents the reported
offences for both Townsville and Queensland for 2016/17.

The average rate of population increase has declined from 1.8 percent per annum over the 10 years to 2017,
to 0.8 percent for the year ending 30 June 2017.
Changes in population occur due to a combination of natural increase/decreases (Births minus Deaths) and net
migration increase/decreases (immigration minus emigration). Figure 15 illustrates the components to
population increase for the period 2001 through to 2017.
Figure 15: Components to Population Increase – Townsville, 2001 – 2017.

editions. QGSO.

Over the 17 years to 2017, Townsville averaged net migration of 1,858 per annum. Recent net migration
peaked in 2007 (pre-GFC) at 3,180 with a sharp decline coinciding with the end of the mining boom in 2013. In
2017, net migration was -761. This was the second consecutive year of negative migration. The downturn in
mining investment and the closure of Queensland Nickel’s Yabulu Refinery were significant contributing
factors to declines in net migration. This has also been compounded by recent restructuring of Australian
Public Service functions within Townsville, resulting in the estimated loss of 200 full-time equivalent positions.
Given the physical and emotional effort involved in moving inter-regionally, there is a significant lag between
loss of employment and emigration. This is evident in Figure 16, with net migration going into decline in 2016
(-412) and 2017 (-761). This decline will continue until Townsville returns to pre-recession employment levels
of approximately 100,000 jobs. This requires the addition of approximately 10,000 jobs (10%).

Address of Inquiry Terms of Reference

4.1

Inequality between Capital and Regional Cities

This section addresses the Inquiry’s terms of reference relevant to Townsville.

Economic opportunities, population and employment growth are not distributed evenly. As outlined, output
and employment are shifting from manufacturing, agriculture and mining to the services sectors. Skilled
service jobs are in high demand and tend to cluster in capital cities.
The ensuing increase in capital city population results in congestion and rising demand for goods and services
and infrastructure investment. This further pump-primes the capital city economies with influxes of
government infrastructure and service funding and private investment and consumption.
An example of government funding favouring capital cities is evident in the 2018/19 Federal budget, the
centrepiece of which is a $75 billion commitment to transport infrastructure over 10 years. New federal
initiatives, as illustrated in figure 16, are overwhelmingly within capital cities. Few come near Townsville, with
Bruce highway funding almost exclusively being allocated to South-East Queensland.
Figure 16: New Major Projects – Transport Infrastructure

Source: Federal Budget Paper 2018/19.

Other initiatives include: $5.3 billion towards the Western Sydney Airport; $9.3 billion for the Melbourne to
Brisbane Inland Rail; and, $4.2 billion and $2.1 billion for New South Wales and Victoria respectively from the
sale of Snowy Hydro, the proceeds of which will be channelled into productive infrastructure.

Townsville North Queensland’s 2018/19 Federal Budget submission is attached at Appendix A . Despite the
identified need for government support, none of these initiatives were taken up. The city received no
additional funding and was not specifically included in any capital works initiatives. This is despite Townsville
being the beneficiary of a federal government “City Deal”.

What causes regions to prosper?

Long-term regional prosperity is intrinsically linked to:
•
•
•
•
•

access to markets and competitively priced inputs of production
scale (population and industry)
diversity of, or the ability of the region to diversify
Skills and education
amenity (lifestyle and services)

Agglomeration economics explains that already concentrated populations tend to grow faster because they
have access to markets, high quality human capital, and the infrastructure that facilitates economic
7
interactions .
The development of knowledge-based service industries relies on the concentration of firms and services.
Government has a role in developing the infrastructure and architecture (physical and soft) necessary for
people to acquire knowledge and for businesses to innovate and develop. This includes facilitating access to
markets and creating the liveability needed to attract and retain skilled people. It also includes equitable
availability of government services and distribution of government expenditure.
Where a region’s economy is significantly centred on an historic advantage, and one or more factors of
production change over time, then that region is at risk of structural decline and subsequent socioeconomic
disadvantage. This was the situation for Newcastle in the 1980s and 90s with its economy founded on
competitive advantages in natural resources (coal & iron ore & steel manufacturing). The transition for
Newcastle was centred on economic diversification with a focus on service industries. Initiatives focused on
the architecture for innovation and entrepreneurship and creating the urban environment (CBD) attractive to
industry.
Newcastle’s economic adjustment was lead, managed and coordinated through local, state and federal
partnerships, with funding significantly provided by the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments. It
played a significant part in facilitating the necessary economic transition, while revitalising the CBD and
mitigating the social and personal costs of adjustment.
Newcastle’s situation in the 1980s and 1990s is not dissimilar to Townsville’s today.
Successful adjustment and transition requires that all levels of government, the private sector and community
work together to achieve shared goals and objectives. This needs a well communicated multilateral strategic
approach, working across government and electoral cycles, with a focus on employment creation, economic
diversification and re and upskilling initiatives.

Policy settings: addressing regional inequality

Broadly speaking, regional development policy should provide a practical response to state and national
growth management needs. It should extend the focus of state and federal governments beyond capital cities
to more evenly, efficiently and equitably spread growth, to provide regional development opportunities and
address socioeconomic disadvantage. Practical measures to achieve this could include, inter alia:
•
•
•

•
•
•

Subsidised and/or supported essential service provision (energy, insurance, labour etc.)
Decentralisation of government services. This should be more than moving a department or office
from Sydney to Paramatta or from Melbourne to Geelong
Regional location incentives – (e.g. business and individual tax incentives, including meaningful zonal
tax offsets that recognise regional inequality and the additional cost of living within regional and
remote areas)
Local procurement processes – local industry engagement policies and procedures
funded regional development plans
Budgeted regional infrastructure plans

Infrastructure investment does play an important role in mitigating disadvantage and redirecting growth to
targeted locations. Provision of quality infrastructure and services in regional centres is a vital element of any
strategy to attract investment and population growth.
The process of addressing regional inequality starts with a commitment from all levels of government to work
together to deliver common goals. These partnerships, and the initiatives enacted within them, must recognise
the relative capacity of partners, with the federal government taking the significant resourcing role.
At a targeted level, policies and programs to address regional industry adjustment and inequality need to be
developed and implemented at the local level through inter-governmental and community partnerships. This
requires whole-of-government partnerships working together to identify barriers, develop agreed goals and
implement specific initiatives and programs.
In December 2016, the Commonwealth, Queensland Government and Townsville City Council enacted
Australia's first City Deal.
The Townsville City Deal is a 15-year inter-governmental commitment focused on improving the lives of
Townsville residents. It provides an approach for government and the community to work together to deliver
transformative outcomes for Townsville. The framework has been designed to transform Townsville and drive
economic growth. Over 15 years the Townsville City Deal will:
•
•
•
•
•

revitalise development, particularly in the city and Waterfront PDA
activate industry and export growth
support long term growth of local businesses
enhance liveability
improve planning, coordination and governance.

The process and timelines for the City Deal are outlined below.

Page 18 of 21

The objectives of the Townsville City Deal will be delivered through the following broad initiatives:

Capital of North Queensland

Innovative and Connected City

Industry Powerhouse for the North
Port City

Defence Hub
Enabling Infrastructure

Details of the City Deal are available at: https://cities.infrastructure.gov.au/townsville-city-deal .
The Townsville City Deal is in its second year of implementation. While Townsville City Council is encouraged
with progress made in establishing the deal, further work must be done to drive outcomes under the deal. The
level of funding commitment and practical implementation to drive investment and social equality, particularly
at the federal level, has been disappointing. This lack of commitment is evident in the 2018/19 Federal Budget
outcomes as discussed in section 4.1 above, and Townsville City Council looks forward to the opportunity to
redress this situation.
The Townsville City Council has identified a number of priorities requiring federal support.
Regionalisation Policy:
•
•
•
•

Relocation of federal government functions to Townsville and the devolution of
authority and decision making to regional Australia
Supported regional immigration schemes
Supported foreign student programs
Improved availability of reliable regional social, economic and demographic data and
analysis

Conclusion

Regional inequality does exist. A significant contributing factor is the shift from resource (agriculture, mining,
and manufacturing) to service industries. This shift has profound geographic consequences with the loss of
jobs in manufacturing and agriculture most acutely experienced in regional centres. Skilled service jobs are in
high demand, but these cluster in capital cities. Governments respond by increasing scarce infrastructure
investment in these cities. The resultant inequalities are impacting the political climate with the influence of
minor parties increasing, particularly in regional Australia. This is a logical response to the perception of
political biases.
Townsville is being impacted by synchronised cyclical (mining) and structural (manufacturing) industry decline.
This is being compounded by Federal Government fiscal decisions resulting in the loss of Australian Public
Service jobs within the city. These forces underlie deterioration in confidence, investment, employment,
income and growth. The subsequent economic and demographic effects are cause for government
intervention to allow the region, its industries and residents, to adjust effectively and take advantage of new
opportunities arising from the Indo-Pacific region.
A significant contributing factor to regional decline is energy affordability. This is due in significant part to
successive Australian and state governments failing to balance competing priorities of competition, security,
reliability and emissions targets, without adequate regard to the impacts on affordability and business
viability. Like energy, significantly higher cost of household and business insurance and travel is creating
regional inequality and cost of living pressures for Townsville residents.
The Townsville City Deal is a 15-year commitment focused on improving the lives of Townsville residents
through job creation, economic growth, investment in local infrastructure, a revitalised urban centre, and a
more vibrant and liveable city. It provides an approach for government to work together to deliver
8
transformative outcomes for Townsville . Enacted in December 2016, the Townsville City Deal has spent much
of the ensuing time in understanding the economic climate and the factors impacting it and in developing and
implementing plans to redress these.
Given the economic climate, increasing social disadvantage and the commitment provided under the City Deal,
Townsville and North Queensland are very disappointed with the 2018/19 Federal budget. Townsville received
no additional funding and was not specifically included in any capital works initiatives. Nothing was delivered
under the City Deal.
Governments hold a central role in mitigating disadvantage and redirecting growth to targeted locations. The
City Deal provides the basis to achieving this for Townsville. We look forward to working with the Federal
Government in achieving the objectives of the Townsville City Deal in a timely and tangible way.

FOREWORD
Townsville North Queensland encompasses five
major regional centres: Townsville, Charters
Towers, Burdekin, Palm Island and Hinchinbrook.
The region contributes over $15.94B annually to
the Queensland economy and is home to nearly
240,000 people. Townsville itself is now Australia’s
13th largest city and is acknowledged by State and
National Governments as the ‘Capital of Northern
Australia’. The region has one of the most diverse
economic bases in Australia and enjoys a stunning
natural environment that provides tourism growth
opportunities and an attractive lifestyle for its
residents.
Key state and national policy documents highlight
the critical importance of Townsville and North
Queensland as a driver of national economic
growth and job creation. The signing of Australia’s
first ever City Deal for Townsville is testament to
the commitment of three levels of Government
to drive economic growth, unlock potential for
the broader region and encourage business and
industry development to help Townsville and North
Queensland become:
t he economic gateway to Asia and Northern

Australia;

Projects and policies that promote economic
diversification and growth are key and leading those
priorities is a major focus on the issues of Water and
Energy. For a region abundant with natural resources,
it is no longer acceptable for our businesses and
our community to live with the unsustainable costs
of accessing these basic necessities and this budget
submission strongly focuses on addressing these two
economic development inhibitors.
Supporting the Water and Energy priorities are a
package of projects and policies that will drive new
job generation, create economic opportunity and
encourage business and industry to invest.
Townsville Enterprise is calling on the Federal
Government to commit to the following:

Enabling Infrastructure
Water Security for Townsville
S
 ustainable North Queensland Energy Pricing and

Infrastructure

Port City
Port of Townsville Channel Capacity Upgrade Project

a
 global leader in tropical and marine research and

innovation;

T
 ownsville Eastern Access Rail Corridor (TEARC) and

the Mount Isa to Townsville Rail Connection
a
 prosperous and highly-liveable city for residents

and visitors.
But Townsville and its immediate region has been
doing it tough in recent years and needs targeted
government investment and policy support to reverse
economic decline.
Investment in projects such as the North Queensland
Stadium and the Singapore-Australia Comprehensive
Strategic Partnership are welcome initiatives that are
applauded in the region, but much more needs to be
done if the region’s true potential is to be unlocked for
local, state and national benefit.
As a community we have all worked hard to secure
major investments into projects and, to their credit,
Local, State and Federal Governments have played
major roles in the economic recovery of the North
Queensland region. As a result, the region is proud to
boast a multimillion dollar pipeline of projects that is
driving renewed confidence and investment and more
than 10,000 jobs have been created in the past 12
months.

Recommendation
C
 ommission and complete business case studies for connecting the Haughton Pump station to the adjoining

high-voltage transmission network and developing an integrated solar energy array to offset energy costs;

C
 ommit to a whole-of-government approach to the development of the Big Rocks Weir and the increased

allocation of water under the Burdekin Basin Water Plan.

The Issue
South East Queensland normally has around 10 years’
water supply in storage, whereas the Townsville North
Queensland region only has around two years’ supply.
Townsville North Queensland’s lack of water
infrastructure is constraining development across the
region. While the Burdekin is the third largest river
system in Australia, only 2% of its water is currently
captured.
The Townsville City Council Local Government Area is
on Level 3 Water Restrictions and commenced pumping
from the Burdekin Dam on 13 November 2017.

1. Townsville Water Security
The Townsville Water Security Taskforce handed
down its Interim Report to Local, State and Federal
Governments in June 2017. This report recommended
that the following works commence immediately:
a) B
 uild an additional 1,800mm diameter steel pipeline
and install additional pumps (of 234ML/day capacity)
from Haughton Pump Station to Ross River Dam;
b) Increase the capacity by 234ML/day of the existing
SunWater pump station and gravity channel from
Clare to Haughton Pump Station; and

S
 ourcing cheaper energy by connecting new and

existing pumps at the Haughton Pump Station to
nearby high voltage lines; and
E
 mbracing green energy via the installation of

battery-ready 5MW solar energy array to offset
energy costs and sell excess into the National
Energy Market.

Page 6 of 24

Townsville Enterprise recognises and commends the
bipartisan political commitment of $225M to deliver
the duplication of the Haughton Pipeline. Given the
significant constraints and risks inherent in the existing
pipeline, the ongoing nature of water shortages
for Townsville, and Townsville North Queensland’s
unacceptably high level of unemployment, Townsville
Enterprise is seeking Federal Government support for
the acceleration of funding for this project over two
years and not the four years currently forecast.
As yet there has been no commitment to investigate
and/or implement recommendation c). The prohibitive
cost of pumping ensures that Townsville remains on
level 3 water restrictions. If Townsville is to viably
achieve the required level of water security, it must
significantly increase the efficiency and reduce
the cost of pumping from the Burdekin system.
Townsville Enterprise is seeking support for the timely
completion of feasibility studies and business cases
for the connection of the Haughton Pump Station to
the adjoining Powerlink high-voltage network and the
potential development of an integrated solar energy
array to reduce and offset energy costs.

2. Regional Water Security
The Burdekin River Basin covers an area of 136,000
km², equating to almost 3/5ths of the size of the state of
Victoria. The Burdekin River is Australia’s largest river
by (peak) discharge volume. Located approximately
200 km south of Townsville, the Burdekin Falls Dam
is Queensland’s largest dam (1,860,000ML or 4 times
the capacity of Sydney Harbour). The Dam supplies
irrigation in the Lower Burdekin as well as mining
in the Bowen Basin. It is currently an alternative
source of urban water supply for Townsville (pumping
commenced on 13 November 2017).

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 118

<< Continued
Future agricultural (Water for Bowen) and industrial
(Mining Galilee Basin) demand for water, combined
with Townsville’s increasing reliance on the Burdekin
as population increases, will place increasing pressure
on Dam water allocations. Dam safety upgrade is also
required to meet State guidelines.
The Burdekin Falls Dam was designed and developed
to go to Stage 2 (Dam wall raised 2 metres, to deliver
150,000ML). In addition to increased water supply,
the raising of the wall will improve the viability of the
proposed pump hydro and increase the long-term
efficiency of directly supplying Townsville’s water.
There are benefits in incorporating Stage 2 into the
Dam safety upgrades required by 2035.

Townsville Enterprise is seeking a commitment
to a whole-of-government approach, led by the
Coordinator General, to the design, approval and
development of the Big Rocks Weir supporting
economic development within the Upper Burdekin.
Townsville Enterprise is also calling on the Queensland
Government to increase the water allocation for the
Upper Burdekin (currently restricted to 20,000ML) as
part of the review of the Burdekin Basin Water Plan.

The Solution
Townsville Enterprise is seeking Government support
for the whole-of-catchment management and
development of the Burdekin Basin water resources.
Priorities for the region are:
A
 ccelerated delivery of secure and affordable water

The Department of State Development is undertaking
a feasibility study into raising the Burdekin Falls Dam.
The study is due for completion in the first quarter
of 2018. Dependent on the recommendations of
the Burdekin Falls Dam Raising Feasibility Study,
Townsville Enterprise is seeking a commitment to
progress the final investment decision for the raising
of the Burdekin Falls Dam.

3. Developing the Upper Burdekin – The
Dalrymple Scheme

for Townsville;
F
 inalisation of the business case for Burdekin Falls

Dam Stage 2 with a final investment decision;
W
 hole-of-government approach to the assessment,

approval and development of Big Rocks Weir and
the establishment of large-scale irrigated agriculture
in the Upper Burdekin.

Townsville Enterprise is currently undertaking the
Hells Gates Dam Feasibility Study. This Study is looking
at the opportunity for large-scale irrigated agriculture
within the Upper Burdekin (The Dalrymple Scheme).
It will also investigate the viability of a water pipeline
to Townsville. The Study will be completed in the
second quarter of 2018. It is a strategic project, which,
if feasible, will be developed over a 10–20 year plus
timeframe.
Initial findings indicate the availability of
approximately 60,000 hectares of soil suitable for
irrigated agriculture in proximity to the Burdekin River.
The likely water delivery and storage mechanisms will
be a series of weirs supported by a drought and flood
mitigation Dam at Hells Gates. The Charters Towers
Regional Council has strongly advocated for the
building of the Big Rocks Weir over many years. The
Weir would augment urban and industrial supply of
Charters Towers and ultimately facilitate and support
the development of up to 20,000 hectares of irrigated
agriculture. The project has the support of local
landholders, who are prepared to make significant onfarm investments to make the project viable. Big Rocks
Weir is critical to the development of the Dalrymple
Scheme and would be required at an early stage in the
Scheme’s development.

SUSTAINABLE NORTH QUEENSLAND
ENERGY PRICING / ACCESS
Recommendation
F
 ast-track the establishment of cost effective ‘clean technology’ base load generation in North Queensland

(seek diversification of ownership);

T
 he next 2,000MW of electricity generation to be licensed in Queensland must be based in North Queensland

and connected to the grid north of Collinsville;

F
 ederal Government must use its influence to police the behaviour of the generators so that wholesale prices

match the costs of production – not prices driven by market distortion;

A
 review of the existing regulatory framework must be expedited in order to address North Queensland’s

particular issues (this may require the establishment of a different regulatory framework to that of South
East Queensland); and

E
 nsure North Queensland has future access to competitively priced natural gas.

The Issue
North Queensland electricity prices are having a
crippling affect upon industry and the local economy.
Base electricity prices, exclusive of network and
environmental charges, have more than doubled in
the past three years (between 2015 and 2017) and
continue to increase at a rate of 30% year on year.
The current uncertainties over pricing and secure
access to energy markets, including Townsville’s lack
of connection to the national natural gas network,
is negatively impacting upon the national and
international competitiveness of North Queensland
industry, the region’s capacity to attract investment
and the economy’s ability to generate sustainable
employment.
Australia’s real electricity prices have increased
far more than any other OECD nation. In terms of
competitive position, Queensland has moved over
the past five years from among the most costeffective electricity producers to among the most
expensive. This has occurred in an environment of
the Queensland market being oversupplied with
generation capacity by around 30% (Queensland
Productivity Commission, 2016).
Wholesale electricity prices have increased
significantly across the National Electricity Market
(NEM) since 2012, with Queensland (168% increase to
2017) and South Australia (178% increase) experiencing
particularly rapid price rises. Queensland prices have
thus far risen by 30% in 2017.

Page 8 of 24

Queensland’s generation assets are more highly
concentrated than other mainland NEM regions,
located in the south east and central regions of
the State. The State Government owns or controls
the dispatch of nearly two-thirds of the generation
capacity through Stanwell and CS Energy and nearly
all of the State’s network infrastructure/ companies.
Queensland’s network (and distribution) costs
have primarily been responsible for the increase in
electricity costs over recent decades, contributing 82%
of the growth in the real cost of electricity (Queensland
Productivity Commission, 2016).
For North Queensland business and industry to be
competitive, there is a vital need to generate more
power in North Queensland. GHD’s 2013 North
and North-West Queensland Sustainable Resource
Feasibility Study affirms that the establishment of
additional largescale base load generation in the north
would apply significant downward pressure to power
pricing across the region – simply because of the
way prices are defined by the existing flow of energy
within the system. The fact is that large energy users
in Northern Australia – industry, manufacturers and
big business – have their energy costs made of ‘energy
prices’, ‘losses’ (through transmission) and ‘energy
charges’. These are all government regulated charges
that in many cases are determined by the flows (and
losses) of energy from south to north.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 118

<< Continued

The Solution

By generating 2,000MW of energy in North
Queensland, this established power flow from north to
south would thereby reverse the cycle and the impact
of transmission losses and reduce regulated energy
charges.

North Queensland requires a cohesive, properly
formulated national energy policy that will work to
realise sustainable/ competitive energy (electricity/
gas) solutions supportive of the region’s future.

Simply put, by allowing the north to generate more
energy we would be able to drive down energy costs
to levels similar to major industrial centres such as
Gladstone which currently enjoy a significant power
price advantage. 2,000MW could be made up of a
variety of energy sources, including renewables.
Townsville Enterprise believes the State should use
its regulatory powers to ensure that licences for
the next 2,000MW of energy should be allocated to
North Queensland and connected to the grid north of
Collinsville.
The increases in network prices in the past decade
have been largely due to significant investment by
the State in network infrastructure over this period to
support increased reliability and service standards and
strong projected demand growth. The combination
of rapid price increases and soft economic conditions
have caused average consumption to fall across parts
of the NEM, meaning that the projected increases in
average consumption have not occurred. However,
under the existing revenue cap regulatory framework
lower electricity use has resulted in higher electricity
prices, as fixed network costs (which are the basis for
cost recovery) are spread across smaller volumes of
electricity. The allocation of how network charges are
allocated also needs to be reconsidered.

The Federal and State Governments have an obligation
to work together on behalf of the North Queensland
community in pursuit of this agenda. The Federal
Government should use its significant influence and
establish policy that:
F
 ast-tracks the establishment of cost effective

‘clean technology’ base load generation in North
Queensland (seek diversification of ownership);
T
 he next 2,000MW of electricity generation to be

licensed in Queensland must be based in North
Queensland and connected to the grid north of
Collinsville;
T
 hrough COAG mechanisms secure State

Government commitment to use its influence to
police the behaviour of generators so that wholesale
prices match costs of production – not prices driven
by market distortion;
A
 review of the existing regulatory framework must

be expedited in order to address North Queensland‘s
issues (this may require the establishment of a
different regulatory framework to that of South East
Queensland); and
E
 nsure North Queensland has future access to

competitively priced natural gas.

PORT CITY
PORT OF TOWNSVILLE
CHANNEL CAPACITY UPGRADE PROJECT
Recommendation
T
 he Federal Government to match the State Government’s commitment of $75M towards the $193M Port of

Townsville Channel Capacity Upgrade Project to enable the project to proceed.

The Issue
Townsville Port is the largest container and automotive
port in Northern Australia, supplying a population
of nearly 800,000 people with essential goods and
materials such as fuel, gas, food, furniture, electrical
goods, clothing, cement, bitumen and vehicles.
Farmers export products like sugar, frozen meat,
cattle, fruit and vegetables and mining companies ship
out commodities like copper, lead, zinc and silver. It
also supports critical Defence operations and cruise
tourism in the region and will welcome more than
33,000 passengers and crew during 2017/2018.

I ncrease the capacity of existing berths at the Port

of Townsville to allow for trade growth.
Positive outcomes of this solution include:
C
 ost savings, improved efficiency, safety and

environmental outcomes for freight movement;
I ncreased resilience for North Queensland,

particularly when transport connections to the
south are cut due to severe weather and flood
events;
R
 educed congestion on road and rail networks;

At present the Townsville Port can only accept ships up
to 238 metres in length. Over the past 40 years ship
sizes have grown significantly and are continuing to get
bigger. Townsville’s channel has not kept up with this
growth and is approximately half the width of access
channels as other major ports.
If the channel is not widened, North Queensland will
be dependent on trucking and rail freight over 1,300
km south. This will add increased cost and time for
North Queensland and also be detrimental to the land
based environment. More cruise ships will also bypass
Townsville, having detrimental impacts on tourism
opportunities.

The Solution
The $193M Channel Capacity Upgrade Project is
recognised as a key priority under the ‘Port City’
initiative of the Townsville City Deal agreed between
the Federal Government, State Government and
Townsville City Council.
Widening of the sea channels to Townsville Port will:
E
 nable vessels longer than 238 metres to safely

access Townsville Port;
S
 ignificantly reduce freight on road/rail networks

between Northern Queensland and Brisbane;

Page 10 of 24

I ncreased capacity of Townsville Port to facilitate

domestic and international trade growth;
C
 reating 120 FTE jobs in Townsville during

construction and support 245 FTE jobs in
Queensland;
$
 580M present value of benefits – a Benefit Cost

Ratio of 2.90 and aggregated benefits over 40 years
of $380M.
The business case for the project has been approved
by Port of Townsville shareholding Ministers. An
Environmental Impact Statement has been completed
and Federal Government and State Government
approvals are in place.
The State Government has allocated $75M towards
the project, and has sought a matched $75M grant
funding contribution from the Federal Government,
with the balance of the project to be funded by Port of
Townsville Limited.

CORRIDOR (TEARC) AND THE MOUNT ISA TO
TOWNSVILLE RAIL CONNECTION
Recommendation
F
 ederal Government and State Government to work in partnership to identify public and private sector

financing models that will ensure construction of TEARC can commence as soon as possible;

P
 rioritise and financially support a long-term operating, funding and investment model for the Mount Isa to

Townsville Rail Line that ensures it is a nationally competitive and efficient freight corridor.

The Issue
The Mount Isa to Townsville Rail Line is a critical
piece of freight infrastructure supporting mining,
agricultural and manufacturing industries in North
and North-West Queensland, and servicing the freight
needs of communities across the region.
Townsville North Queensland services the North-West
Minerals Province (NWMP) as well as the broader
Mount Isa to Townsville Economic Development
Zone (MITEZ). The NWMP is one of the world’s richest
mineral producing areas containing copper, lead and
zinc as well as major silver and phosphate deposits
and strong rare earth potential. Over 2015/16 the
NWMP produced 3.4 million tons of throughputs
valued at $4B. The region holds approximately 75% of
Queensland’s base metals supply.
Product from the NWMP is railed and trucked to
Townsville Port for export to global markets. Railing
of product on the Mount Isa to Townsville Rail Line
has decreased in recent years with increased trucking
of product. A lack of reinvestment in the rail line has
resulted in inefficiencies of rail line speed/ restrictions,
lack of passing loops, and lack of multi-user terminals
for loading and unloading of product which has led
to a modal shift of product to road transport. This
modal shift places greater pressure and cost onto the
road network and has resulted in inefficiencies in the
logistical supply chain.
The Northern Territory and Queensland Governments
are currently undertaking a feasibility study of
establishing a new rail line linking the NWMP to the
Port of Darwin. The proposed Mount Isa to Tennant
Creek Railway is a $2–$3B project aimed at expanding
the Mount Isa to Townsville Railway to Tennant Creek
and joining it to the existing Tarcoola to Darwin
Railway in the Northern Territory.

There is a significant risk to the Queensland economy,
and in particular the ongoing contribution made by
the North and North-West Queensland region to the
State’s prosperity, that a Mount Isa to Tennant Creek
Rail Line will result in products from the NWMP being
diverted to the Port of Darwin.
In the State Infrastructure Plan (March 2016),
Infrastructure Australia has earmarked upgrading
the Mount Isa to Townsville Rail Corridor (which
includes TEARC) as a priority project. However, the
State Infrastructure Plan did not allocate funding to
the project over the forward estimates. It is therefore
critical to investigate a 50 year investment and
operating model for the Mount Isa to Townsville Rail
Line that will restore it as a competitive and efficient
freight corridor and become a foremost priority of the
Queensland Government rather than consideration of
a new rail link to the Port of Darwin.
The Townsville Eastern Access Rail Corridor (TEARC)
presents the immediate opportunity to efficiently
connect the Mount Isa Rail Line (and the North-West
Minerals Province) with the Port of Townsville and
resolve existing rail bottlenecks within the Port.
The construction of TEARC is vital to the future growth
of the Port of Townsville and the economic growth
of the broader Townsville North Queensland region.
TEARC would take rail traffic out of Townsville’s
growing urban areas, allow for longer trains (1.4
km), reduce bottlenecks in the Port and provide vital
capacity for the growing tonnage demand on the
Mount Isa Rail Line. The construction of TEARC would
also support the Queensland Ports and National Ports
Strategies.

 upport for the co-location/ relocation of Defence trade training schools and maintenance units with

The Issue
Defence has long been one of the key contributors to
Townsville’s growth and economic diversity. Within
this context, the consideration of Townsville’s Defence
role is also deeply inter-related with the development
of the Townsville region itself. There has been
considerable long-term Defence investment in North
Queensland that, combined, delivers a premier force
generation environment and a proven mounting base
for major operations to the north of Australia.
Presently, it is estimated that approximately 7,500
service men and women are based in Townsville. In all,
Defence personnel and their dependents constitute
about 15,000 people or 8% of Townsville’s population.
There are a high number of ex-Defence personnel who
remain in Townsville and make up a significant and
influential component of the community.
Townsville is a valuable asset for Australia’s Defence
Force capability that must continue to be recognised
and strengthened. Moreover, there is tangible mutual
benefit to be attained through Defence investments
within the Townsville region. Among these are
community support and lifestyle satisfaction, which
are increasingly vital factors in the attraction and
retention of Defence Force personnel.

In this sense, the relationship of Defence and regional
economic development is not merely a choice between
competing policy priorities, but rather the challenge
of maximising capability and economic outcomes
whenever a complementarity between Defence
and developmental interests occurs. The continued
consolidation of Force capabilities within multi-user
bases helps support more rationalised logistics
arrangements, while also promoting innovation, local
economies and skills sharing between Defence and
industry.
In acknowledgement of the region’s ongoing strategic
importance and potential, Federal Government should
look to capitalise upon Townsville North Queensland’s
geographic, operational and strategic advantages
and work in partnership with the Department of
Defence to redefine the State’s strategic priorities
and alignment of relevant government resources.
This agenda should seek to establish Townsville
North Queensland as the ADF’s North Australian –
‘Deep Maintenance, Sustainment, Logistics and ADF
Preparation Hub’ – servicing 1st Brigade operations
in the Northern Territory, tracking east/ south east
to support operations in the Far North and North
Queensland (Cairns and Townsville) and all the way
south to Central Queensland and Shoalwater Bay.

Submission 118

<< Continued

The Solution

The further development of a local economic or
‘Townsville Defence Procurement’ Strategy would
maximise the service and support opportunities made
available via Townsville’s projected growth over the
next twenty years. The ADF’s Integrated Investment
Program (IIP) and procurement policies should be
adjusted to allow for better and direct engagement
with local Townsville firms. In particular, these would
include extended scope for specialised services in
medical development and research, vehicle and
aeronautical maintenance/ repair, family support and
mental health. Local “content” contracts should be
replaced by local contracts. Defence, in Townsville,
should have the capacity to deal directly with local
suppliers and businesses. There are opportunities for
greater public/ private partnerships.

In support of the ‘Defence Hub’ agenda defined
under Townsville’s City Deal, we seek the Federal
Government’s support in ensuring that Townsville
continues to play a significant role in the Australian
Defence landscape through:

Furthermore, there are a number of initiatives
available to facilitate force concentration within the
Townsville region. These would involve, firstly, the
continued relocation to Townsville of elements of the
Defence Materiel Organisation, Defence Science and
Technology Organisation (DSTO), intelligence agencies,
service, health and logistics headquarters, that
support operations in the Asia Pacific. Organisations,
like the DSTO, would be better able to leverage and
share information with key regional agencies currently
developing tropical solutions in energy and health.
The growth of a strong Defence industry in North
Queensland would prove a significant regional job
creator for generations to come, benefiting not only
transitioning and ex-military personnel but also
providing opportunity for the broader community,
local business and neighbouring regions.

The Solution
The RAN should seek to establish a continuous amphibious
ship presence based out of Townsville from 2019, with a
permanent berth commitment at the Port of Townsville
from 2020. Relevant supporting elements currently
stationed at Fleet Base East and HMAS Kuttabul at Garden
Island should also be gradually relocated. This is consistent
with the acknowledgment in the Defence White Paper 2016
that there are long term viability issues with Garden Island,
including capacity constraints and urban encroachment.
Townsville’s current amphibious role should also
be consolidated. The Australian Strategic Policy
Institute has recommended that the ADF establish an
Amphibious Centre of Excellence to evolve doctrine
and train personnel. Development of this facility should
be prioritised, and it should be based in Townsville.
Proposed Budgetary recommendations include:

CAPITAL OF NORTHERN AUSTRALIA
HIGH GROWTH POPULATION TARGET &
RELOCATION OF GOVERNMENT BODIES
Recommendation
H
 igh growth population target commitment;
I mplement whole-of-government North Australia Population Policy; and
L
 egitimate consideration of the relocation of relevant Federal Government department and agency functions

to Townsville North Queensland, supportive of long-term growth and regional sustainability.

The Issue
Townsville North Queensland needs the right policy
settings in place to retain and attract the population
needed to underwrite its future economic growth.
The Developing Northern Australia White Paper
2015 recognised that rapid population growth is
fundamental to unlocking Northern Australia’s
economic potential and capitalising on its proximity to
the burgeoning economies of Asia and the Tropics.
The broad objective of macroeconomic policy is to
contribute to economic and social wellbeing in an
equitable and sustainable manner.
Unless as a nation we are prepared to make a
strong commitment to address factors that support
the sustainability of regional communities, we will
continue to see the exodus of educated and skilled
labour to capital cities in pursuit of opportunity and
employment. The Federal Government, through the
Northern Australia Agenda vehicle, should deliver
sustainable public-sector employment opportunities
and career paths for locals whilst attracting those that
are living in cities to regional communities.

capitals and regional communities will continue to
widen.
Australia’s southern capital cities are burdened by
a lack of affordable housing options and unable to
address cost of living pressures supportive of their
growing populations. It would only seem practical that
the Federal Government would seek to alleviate this
pressure through the decentralisation and relocation
of departmental and agency operations to regional
centres, seeking to turn the tide of regional migration.
If we take current serving Defence personnel out of
consideration, there are over 243,300 Commonwealth
Government public servants employed nationally, with
less than 2,000 residing in Townsville (ABS; June 2016).
Commonwealth Departments whose partial operation
or sub-departmental agencies may be considered for
rural relocation include:
Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
Department of Agriculture and Water Resources
Department of Communications and the Arts
Department of Defence

Governments of the day have a fundamental
obligation to ensure fair and equitable distribution of
wealth across the nation, supporting and contributing
to the regeneration and sustainability of regional
cities and communities. If governments fail to support
proactive regional development, they run the risk of
economic instability or the establishment of a ‘twospeed’ economy. In the Australian post mining boom
era our country finds itself yet again in the midst of
a two-speed economy, this time comprising: (i) NSW
and Victoria (driven largely by Sydney and Melbourne);
and (ii) the rest of Australia (ROA). The size and relative
strength of the NSW and Victorian economies means
that economic data presented at the national level is
masking weaknesses throughout the ROA, particularly
that of regional centres. Without an interventionist
approach by Government to regional development
stimulus, the economic divide between southern

<< Continued
The Federal Government should not be influenced
by the bureaucracy in its evaluation of the economic
and social benefits of relocating relevant Government
agencies and jobs to regional communities, supportive
of long-term growth and sustainability. Consideration
must also be given to the indirect outcomes associated
with this agenda, with the potential to alleviate major
city congestion and cost of living pressures. The
Townsville Enterprise Senate Enquiry Response to
Department Relocation explores this in detail.

The Solution
1. T
 he Government must put in place a dedicated
Population Policy for Northern Australia and
commit to population targets for each of its
component regions. In Townsville, a population
increase target of 140,000 more people by 2030 is
appropriate. This is consistent with high-growth
scenarios considered by Infrastructure Australia,
but will only be achieved with the right policy mix.
2. T
 he Population Policy should focus not only on
attracting new residents, but also on retaining
existing residents, and should include:
a
 commitment to invest in the economic

infrastructure, social infrastructure and
Government services needed to support the
population target;
l egitimate consideration of the relocation of

relevant Federal Government department
and agency functions to Townsville North
Queensland;
a
 whole-of-government requirement for laws

and policies that affect Northern Australia to
explicitly consider how they will positively impact
population growth targets.

DESTINATION DEVELOPMENT
AUSTRALIAN TROPICAL MARINE
AND AQUACULTURE CENTRE
Recommendation
P
 rovide support for the development of the Australian Tropical Marine and Aquaculture Centre to be based in

the Townsville CBD.

The Issue
Townsville has a world-leading reputation in the
marine sciences. Townsville currently hosts the three
leading international entities in marine and reef
research and protection – James Cook University,
the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. At the
same time, Northern Australia is the epi-centre for
some of Australia’s biggest aquaculture industries,
including farmed prawns, barramundi, pearls and
crayfish, which collectively account for around $300M
of aquaculture product annually. There is significant
transformative capacity and economic potential for
aquaculture industry in Queensland, leading to job
creation and skilled workforce development, the
ability to transfer knowledge and skills to the Asia
Pacific region and with potential flow on effects to
tourism and edu-tourism.
James Cook University is actively seeking to
partner with industry and Townsville research and
tourism organisations to establish the Australian
Tropical Marine and Aquaculture Centre – an
international marine research precinct that will
promote advancements in marine and aquaculture
commercialisation, research and innovation. This
enabling infrastructure will underpin regional
capabilities to ensure our marine industry is able
to grow in a competitive and sustainable way.
Employment and local capacity will flow from the
development of this facility but also ensure the
protection of current marine assets and industry,
growing domestic and export markets and the
development of a skilled workforce.
The development of this Centre will cement
Townsville’s reputation as the world’s leading city
for marine science and link the research experience
explicitly to tourism opportunities, drawing

Page 18 of 24

researchers and industry from around the world and
particularly from Asia to Townsville. This project will
also connect into other proposed marine tourism
projects in the CBD. Additionally, given Townsville’s
proximity to the Asian “dining boom”, the facility
will play a major role in enabling Northern Australia
to develop and export its tropical marine and
aquaculture expertise – while also protecting our
greatest natural asset, the Great Barrier Reef, which
supports a tourism industry worth nearly $5.2B and
over 64,000 jobs.

The Solution
Development of this precinct celebrating the worldleading marine science research in the Townsville
CBD will play an important role in achieving the
development aims of the Waterfront Priority
Development Area, which has designated a specific
‘Research and Tourism Precinct’ – a mixed use area
which will accommodate residential and short-term
accommodation alongside tropical, marine and
research-based tourism activities.
The precinct will stimulate further development in the
area by enabling critical mass of industry, researchers
and students. It will attract new ‘edu-tourists’ and help
build a reputed precinct for knowledge workers within
the CBD. It will also activate construction of supporting
infrastructure including pedestrian walkways and
create a vibrant inner-city location by increasing
demand for higher-density housing within the CBD.
The Federal Government should ensure that adequate
funding is provided to the project, so that it is able to
meet the infrastructure and other costs associated
with the facility and the precinct being based within
the Townsville Priority Development Area.

DESTINATION DEVELOPMENT
MUSEUM OF UNDERWATER ART (MOUA)
Recommendation
T
 he Federal Government provide $5M to support the development of the Southern Hemisphere’s first

Underwater Art Museum.

The Issue
Townsville North Queensland has a growing
reputation for providing unique and enriching
experiences for residents and visitors alike. These
are founded on an inspiring combination of assets,
including the natural environment (reef and rainforest,
weather, etc), international-quality cultural activities
(Strand Ephemera, Australian Festival of Chamber
Music, etc) and world leading scientific and educational
institutions (James Cook University, Australian
Institute of Marine Science, Great Barrier Reef Marine
Park Authority). The Townsville North Queensland
tourism and events industry contributes $1.034B in
output to the local economy annually and supports
more than 5,500 local jobs.
Building on these strengths, Townsville North
Queensland could further strengthen its position
as a leading region in Northern Australia through
facilitation of an underwater art museum.
Underwater art museums are artistic installations,
usually involving sculptured works placed on the
seafloor or riverbeds to provide fascinating visual,
emotional and physical experiences for visitors.
Among the most famous and effective examples of
this art form are works by Jason de Caires Taylor,
who has installed major works in several Northern
Hemisphere locations, including the Bahamas and
Grenada (Caribbean), Cancun (Mexico) and London
(Thames River).
High-quality, large-scale installations such as those
done by de Caires Taylor attract very large numbers
of visitors and high-profile media coverage. Such
installations in the waters adjacent to Townsville would
be the first of their kind in the Southern Hemisphere.
They could be a powerful way to strengthen the city’s
connection to the marine environment, enhance its
international profile, and attract increased visitation
from domestic and international tourists. It could be
a dramatic and enduring way to further differentiate
Townsville North Queensland as an attractive and
progressive region with unique connections between
the Reef, Art and Research.

In 2016, Mr de Caires Taylor’s works achieved a
global press reach of 700M viewers. The world’s first
underwater sculpture park, created by Taylor off the
coast of Grenada in 2006, is now listed by National
Geographic as one of the Top 25 Wonders of the
World. The Museo Subacuático de Arte off the coast
of Cancun, Mexico, created by Taylor in 2009, resulted
in an increase of annual visitor numbers of almost
400,000.
Townsville North Queensland is well positioned as
the centre of excellence globally for marine science,
education and research. The Museum of Underwater
Art (MOUA) provides an opportunity to further extend
the region’s existing educational reef and tourism
offerings to create a seamless learning journey
between the land and ocean.

The Solution
The overarching vision for MOUA is to create a global
art attraction for Townsville North Queensland that
provides a point of differentiation, tells the stories of
the land, people and environment, provides ongoing
economic benefit to the local economy and builds the
capacity of operators and businesses within the local
tourism industry.
The economic impact assessment developed for
MOUA indicates that the project will provide long-term
and sustainable economic benefit to the Townsville
North Queensland region. The MOUA is an $8M
project which will be developed over four locations
predominately within the Great Barrier Reef. During
the construction phase, the project will create 72
jobs, deliver more than $20M in economic output
and will boost the Gross Regional Product (GRP) by
$9.1M. However, it is the flow-on tourism impacts
of this project that are the most remarkable. MOUA
proponents have estimated that the development
would increase tourism to the region by 50,000 visitors
suggesting an economic output of $42M, creation of
182 jobs and an addition to gross regional product of
$20M.

Submission 118

<< Continued
The proposed approach is to establish an Underwater
Art Museum in the waters off Townsville and Palm
Island. In addition to experiential and artistic goals,
the installations would have strong environmental and
educational themes. They would explicitly support
Australia’s major strategic and policy initiatives
relating to the Great Barrier Reef, notably the Reef
2050 Long Term Sustainability Plan and Great Barrier
Reef Marine Park Authority’s management program.
The vision is to create reconciliation and
environmentally themed sculptural installations at
one or two inter-tidal locations (entrance to Townsville
Port, Geoffrey Bay, Magnetic Island (snorkel trails)),
one offshore location (John Brewer Reef) and an
installation off the coast of Palm Island that would be
reflective of its 100 year anniversary celebrations.
The estimated total project cost is $8M over a
three year period. We propose that a public private
partnership funding model is appropriate, supportive
of the project’s realisation. The Queensland State
Government has committed $2M to the project which
has been supported by $750K from the corporate
sector. We are directly seeking $5M in Federal
Government funding support for this project and its
realisation in 2018. An application has been made
through the Building Better Regions Fund supporting
this recommendation for $5M.
Townsville Enterprise is calling on the Federal
Government to support the development of the
Southern Hemisphere’s first Underwater Art Museum.

SUPPORTING THE REGIONS
BURDEKIN SHIRE COUNCIL
Recommendation
F
 ederal Government to provide $2M in funding to support the use of macro-algae to remediate sewerage

effluent harmful to the Great Barrier Reef; and

F
 ederal Government to provide funding support to improve distribution infrastructure to provide water

delivery to the southern end of the Burdekin Shire and maximise the region’s agricultural capacity.

The Issues
Use of Macro-Algae to Remediate Sewerage Effluent
– $2M project
The project involves the cultivation of the freshwater
macro-algae, Oedegonium Intermedium, to remediate
nitrogen and phosphorous from the discharge effluent
of the Ayr/Brandon Sewage Treatment Plant. These
two nutrients represent a significant threat to the
ongoing health of the Great Barrier Reef. Research
conducted over a six week trial period by James
Cook University (JCU) revealed the Oedogonium
consistently reduced the inorganic nitrogen content
of the wastewater from the Ayr/Brandon Wastewater
Treatment Plant to trace levels and reduced total
nitrogen by 84% and total phosphorous by 61%.
The scope of works is to construct and operate,
for a twelve month period, a 1.0 hectare algal
bioremediation facility at the Burdekin Shire Council
(BSC) Ayr/Brandon Wastewater Treatment Plant. The
project will be able to be duplicated at numerous
similar sites in Queensland discharging into the Great
Barrier Reef lagoon at a significantly reduced cost to
conventional upgrade options.
Warren’s Gully System Capacity Upgrade
Lower Burdekin Water requires funds to improve
distribution infrastructure to provide water delivery to
the southern end of the Burdekin Shire.
The project is designed to increase the peak flow of
capacity of the Warren’s Gully Aquifer Recharge and
Water Distribution System from 140 to 250 ML per
day. In order for Lower Burdekin Water to undertake
the works costing in excess of $7.8M the assistance of
Government funding is required.

The project will build capacity for an increase in
irrigated agricultural production within and adjacent
to Lower Burdekin Water’s authority area; an increase
in reliability of aquifer re-charge during peak flow
periods and an expansion in both the extent and the
capacity of Lower Burdekin Water’s infrastructure
through the system.
Currently, there is an increasing demand for water
in the area presently supplied by the Warren’s Gully
Irrigation System and this project will allow for future
agricultural land development in adjoining areas.
There is currently 1,000 hectares of agricultural land
ready to go into production with all necessary planning
and development approvals in place for a further
2,000 hectares of agricultural land, and the potential
for another 2,000 hectares of agricultural land.
This project has many positive outcomes which will
benefit the region including:
A
 dditional employment in the construction phase;
O
 ngoing employment as a result of the increased

agricultural land developed; and
I ncreased household revenue based on the

additional employment generated by the works and
the increase in agriculture and industry.

The Solution
Townsville Enterprise is calling on the Federal
Government to:
P
 rovide $2M in funding to support the use of macro-

algae to remediate sewerage effluent harmful to the
Great Barrier Reef; and
P
 rovide funding support to improve distribution

infrastructure to provide water delivery to the
southern end of the Burdekin Shire and maximise
the region’s agricultural capacity.
