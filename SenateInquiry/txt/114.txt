Dear Sir/Madam
Submission to: Inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in
Australia
We, as the representative Council’s from the Western Queensland Local Government
Association (WQLGA), would like to express our thanks for the invitation to make a submission
to the Senate Economics References Committee on the Inquiry into the indicators of, and
impact of, regional inequality in Australia.
The WQLGA held its Annual General Meeting on Saturday 19th May 2018, in Emerald
Queensland. A motion was carried at the meeting to prepare a submission for the Senate
Inquiry into indicators of and impacts of regional inequality in Australia which collectively
includes inequality issues that are faced by the member Councils.
In order to present a succinct submission, the WQLGA Council’s would like to acknowledge
that the diversity of the Rural, Regional and Remote (RRR) communities and its disparate
landscape presents a multitude of inequalities. Fundamentally, the WQLGA Council’s all face
similar challenges and, in one way or another, are adversely impacted by the following issues:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Management of Feral Pigs
Weed and Pest Management
Problems association with Bounded Localities and Postcode

11. Undervaluing of regional outputs and subsequent infrastructure support
12. Air transport routes and costs
The WQLGA Council’s welcome the opportunity of appearing at the public hearing and are
interested in provide relevant details and contextual information pertinent to the
abovementioned issues at this hearing.
Equality vs Equity
Problem:
While the words ‘equality’ and ‘equity’ are often used interchangeably and with no clear
pragmatic difference. Importantly, equality denotes that everyone is at the same level and, as
a result, should receive the identical apportionment of something in order to fulfil happy and
healthy lives. In contrast, equity, aims to represent fairness and involves trying to apportion
what is needed to achieve the outcome necessary.
While this explanation might appear trivial, the WQLGA would like to encourage the federal
government to consider this concept when planning, preparing and delivering funding models
or allocating resources to RRR communities. It is incumbent on the WQLGA’s to appropriately
advocate for a fair share of the apportionment to ensure that RRR communities can maintain
and, where necessary, re-invigorate communities to attract and retain families, jobs and
businesses.

Solution:
It stands to reason that when considering the above explanation and designing solutions for
RRR communities, a renewed approach will be required to adequately address challenges in
RRR communities be considering how to apportion resources to achieve the outcome required
and not to just be ‘equal’ to the metropolitan communities.
Yours faithfully

Cr Kerry Hayes
President
