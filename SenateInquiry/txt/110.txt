THE INDICATORS OF, AND IMPACT OF REGIONAL INEQUALITY IN
AUSTRALIA

Introduction
The prosperity of regional Australian towns and communities (as a whole) has undergone a
significant slowdown over the last decade. There are a range of economic, political,
geographic and societal factors that have contributed to the success or failure of regional
Australian areas which should be reviewed with intent for action to address identified
inequalities.
Australia is undergoing substantial growth in population and the societal and economic
impacts of this growth are profound in regional Australia; as a larger proportion of population
growth focuses around metropolitan areas, improvements in infrastructure and support in the
regions become proportionally neglected. Areas which are reliant on primary production are
significantly negatively impacted by these changes.
Having said that, a significant portion of the Australian population still continues to live in
regional areas of the country. Primary industries such as agriculture and resources are large
contributors to the local economies of many regions. Technological advancement has led to
significant industry growth, which is misleading as this does not necessarily equate to
economic improvement for the individuals or the region at large (given the multinational
investment in such industries).
Regional livelihood is a founding characteristic of Australia, the cultural and economic
importance of supporting their investment, in ensuring these communities have the opportunity
to thrive, is as important now than ever. This makes it incumbent upon Governments to ensure
there are strategies in place to support regionally based populations and leverage the vast
resources and land that is available to safeguard the contributions which the population of
regional towns and cities make to the Australian economy.
A survey of Regional Capital Alliance WA (RCAWA) members of regional Western Australia
has been conducted to gain perspective on some of the issues in relation to regional inequality
which are captured further in this brief.

Inequality in Access to Opportunities
People living in regional and remote communities have limitations (for a range of reasons) in
accessing equivalent levels of service provision or personal/communal opportunities that
are available to those living in and around major metropolitan areas. There are a range of
identified areas in which this occurs.

Education Services
The availability of education opportunities in regional locations is a widely recognised issue,
particularly the ease of access to tertiary education opportunities for young adult Australians.
Whilst students are afforded a minimum standard of schooling across the regions, schools in
regional areas perform comparatively worse than metropolitan schools and consistently
maintain lower rankings.
Tertiary education is the primary issue recognised by regional representatives, with significant
issues being raised in relation to a range of accessibility concerns:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Ability to go straight to university, given situational environment;
Cost of relocating and living to accommodate studying away from home;
Availability of options for tertiary education;
Associated travel costs;
Youth sports, culture and arts and specialised callings (eg aeronautical) ,
opportunities, particularly for high level talent; and,
Mental and emotional health of students forced to relocate to the metropolitan areas
in order to access educational opportunities (as a result of separation, financial or
personal stresses etc.).

Further to tertiary education, the comparatively low rate of trade qualified mentors or
availability of other avenues for professional development in regional areas, particularly lowpopulation areas, leads to either:
•
•

Permanent loss of future skilled trade qualified individuals or qualified operators in
other industries; or
Excessive costs to the local region for access to the skillsets of qualified individuals
who choose to remain in the region (lack of competition).

Health Services
Regional areas have suffered comparatively to metropolitan areas in the local provision of
healthcare. Particularly inequitable are the provision of (or access to) specialist services,
mental health support and carer functions (such as rehabilitation, palliative care etc.). Other
issues relating to regional health service provision include:
•
•

A genuine lack of choice in service providers; and
The exorbitant costs of transport in conjunction with excessive accommodation costs
for rurally or remotely located people to access health care facilities which metropolitan
based patients take for granted as nearby.

Submission 110

Regional Capitals Australia (RCA) noted in their submission to the Federal Inquiry, that:
•
•
•
•

Where a regional capital city has a better health access rank, then the rural town will
also have a comparatively better rank;
The poorer the level of access the regional capital city’s has, the poorer the rural town’s
access to health services;
The smaller the regional capital cities (population) is, the lower the health access rank
is, which also affects the rural towns’ ranks;
The more remote a regional capital city is, the poorer access it has to health access
which also affects the rural towns’ access.

The correlation between level of health service access and regional locality for individuals is
widely accepted, and action is required to redistribute functional health services to ensure
more Australians have equitable access to a higher level baseline service.

Community Based Economic Opportunities
Regional communities often rely on investment from metropolitan based or international
companies to support the local economy. Unfortunately, particularly in some volatile
industries, this foundation is unsustainable. Resource based organisations act on global
commodity prices and the bottom line is of primary concern. Agricultural economic
contributions are seasonal at best and heavily reliant on prevailing climatic conditions. A
strategy and support mechanism to ensure regional economic stability which correlates with
the metropolitan capitals is necessary to ensure regional areas are sustainably managed.
There is a range of economic impacts that affect regional areas and communities. These
include, but are not limited to:
•

With the exception of a small number of high performing resource production regions,
income inequality between metropolitan areas and regional areas is significant.
People living in regional, and particularly rural and remote areas, are substantially
disadvantaged in comparative income, with a lower average weekly wage. This has a
twofold impact on individuals in that there is a decrease in disposable income, yet
goods and services in regional areas cost the consumer more due to a range of
commercial cost of production factors.

•

The unemployment rate in regional Australia is traditionally significantly higher than in
metropolitan areas. This is due to a range of causal factors including skills shortages
as a result of migration/relocation, limited education and/or skills training, erratic
seasonal employment requirements and in particular, (given the common regional
industries) technological advancement in high production volume machinery and
equipment.

•

The economic downturn in the retail and other related industries for example has
meant cost cutting measures have lead to reduced support from companies to regional
centres with less emphasis and investment on dedicated regional staff support. For
example, retail area manager numbers have been reduced with the consequence of
further isolating regional staff. This has also meant that flow on economic benefits from
these regular visitors has been lost.

•

Attracting investment and development is difficult given the significant outlays required
for a business to undergo relocation and development with appropriate infrastructure.

•

Distances from major metropolitan regions plays a significant role in the ability of
regional towns and cities to attract major investments and or developments.

•

Costs of production in non-resource/agricultural industries in a regional environment
are invariably going to be significantly higher due to a range of factors. The cost of
increased skilled labour when it is unavailable locally, transport costs for labour,
delivery of materials or delivery to market, and depending on region, reliance on
volatile natural climatic or geographic conditions to ensure productivity is not impacted.

Individual Career Advancement Opportunities
For professionals located in regional areas, continued career development can be difficult
given centralised structures of modern large-scale corporations. For continued advancement,
there is an expectation that individuals relocate to pursue higher level work in their chosen
field (if they are not already centrally located). Of course, this is not always the case,
particularly in some of the more common regionally based industries, but it still represents an
issue of skill and knowledge displacement from the regions.
The ability to attract and retain professional people due to cost of relocation is also an affecting
factor. Relocation to regional areas can be viewed as a potential career disadvantage. This
impacts on the ability of regions to replace skills that leaves for career advancement with other
adequately skilled, experienced and qualified staff.

Views on the Causes of Inequality Between Regions
There is a wide range of potential causes that have been identified as sources of inequality
between metropolitan and regional areas. Several factor are outlined as follows:
•

Small population and dispersion of population which limits economies of scale in the
provision of services and negatively influences corporate/industrial investment in the
region due to cost and risk against value;

•

Diminished regional opportunities for youth and professionals given accessibility to
education institutions, (relative) limited employment opportunities, professional
development opportunities and access to other social and community benefits
(organised sports, libraries, social groups etc.);

•

The proximity of a regional area to a state capital or major metropolitan area is
significant in migration, tourism and the ability of a region to attract investment;

•

A lack of investment in infrastructure projects in regional areas which would generate
local jobs and provide long term infrastructure to leverage regional economic
development;

•

A lack of specialised industries due to economies of scale and accessibility to
infrastructure and support;

Submission 110

•

Reaching and maintaining a sustainable population size and maintaining the support,
infrastructure and economic opportunities to ensure continued viability for industry
investment;

•

Particularly in Western Australia, the large-scale distances between regions and
communities which makes equal provision of services and support a difficult
proposition;

•

Transport costs, both for the delivery of essential items and for industry related
transport to and from source, and transport costs for individuals such as airfares (often
more expensive than travel between coasts), fuel and appropriate vehicles for the
region.

Over many years Governments have implemented policy which has effectively reduced
essential government services (or replacing them with call centres or online services) from the
regions and centralised to the metropolitan areas. This has resulted in diminished government
service delivery to the regions. This has impacted negatively on the regions, both in terms of
ensuring effective regional service delivery and in maintaining regional identities.
The new State Government is recognising this by recently completing a service delivery review
to meet community expectations and needs including Regional WA and is implementing a
series of recommendations and actions to address this.
Since 2008 this issue has been significantly countered by state government initiatives using
direct intervention policies to redress this situation such as the Western Australian “Royalties
for Regions program” whereby some $6bn was directly invested into regional WA via 4500
projects above and beyond core government service delivery and infrastructure investments.

Economics of Regional Inequality and Wider Impacts
There is a range of economic issues related to regional and metropolitan inequality which can
result in significant detrimental consequences to regional Australian areas (and communities)
if not appropriately managed. These issues include:
•

The cost of providing equivalent services is generally higher in the regions, often due
to an inability to maintain economies of scale;

•

The cost of living in general is higher, however social support is not adequately
accounted for; and,

•

Transport costs (commercial, industrial and personal) are excessive due to a range of
factors which impacts on both regional investment and on individual disposable income
levels – which in turn effects regional economic performance when analyse on a macro
level.

A ‘Hub and Spoke’ network is a suggested potential mechanism to ensure that all regional
areas are adequately supported. The hub and spoke is comprised of both infrastructure
aspects and functional aspects where the larger town (regional capitals) act as support centres
and centres of commerce for all the towns in the region. Smaller regional towns form the
‘spokes’ located around the larger regional town (the ‘hub’). This model ensure greater ease
of accessibility to economic infrastructure, technology and support by making these aspects
much more geographically accessible.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 110

The strength of a regional area becomes intrinsically linked with the economic performance of
the regional capital. Government investment in the regional capital then effectively has a
twofold effect as the investment benefits both the town/regional city and the ‘spoke’ towns that
rely on the economic success of the hub. Such a model can drastically improve the access to
essential social services and infrastructure which regionally based people can experience
such as employment opportunities, health services, education opportunities, financial services
and national and international transport.

Solutions to Inequality Between Regional Areas
Inequality between regional and metropolitan Australia requires a range of policy and regional
investment activity to be effectively managed long term. The identification of such solution
strategies is critical in ensuring adequate planning, preparation and funding needs are
established to guarantee the success of the overall objective (regional equality). Strategies
suggested to alleviate the disparate level of opportunities and access include:
•

Facilitating collaboration and developing partnerships between key regional
stakeholders and government agencies;

•

Investing in regional tertiary and vocational education to establish greater support,
accessibility and retention for regional and remote students;

•

Retirement trends and associated health care requirements and opportunities.

•

Leveraging the natural resources of the state to enhance tourism across the regions
whilst investing in tourism initiatives which will offer excellent return on investment
whilst setting the state apart from other destinations;

•

Continued investment in the resources sector and partnership with industry leaders to
enhance the sustainable economic development of regional centres and towns;

•

Identification of and investment in other industrial initiatives which will support regional
areas in improving accessibility and sustainable economic growth;

•

Regional areas are an important part of investigating non-standard or infant
technologies so that Australia can lead in fields such as renewable energy and waste
management;

•

Decentralisation of critical government support mechanisms and other government
functions to ensure both upstream (such as employment opportunities and
development) and downstream (support mechanisms) aspects of government are
accessible across the regions; and

•

Creating regional environments that are a liveable, investable and affordable
alternative to the metropolitan regions to entice both commercial and residential
investment, by promoting the regional resources and culture.

A key solution to this problem (regional inequality) which was identified by Regional Capitals
Australia is the establishment of the Federal government’s City Deals initiative which aims to
invest in the development of regional capital cities to act as a hub for their corresponding
region. This has been established as recognition of the need for development of a network of
socially and economically thriving regional capital cities and its importance to the nation’s
growth. The Western Australian Government should ensure it is strategically positioned to
‘piggyback’ off the federal initiative throughout development of the strategy.

Policy Settings to Address Regional Inequality
The Government needs to take a proactive approach to strategic policy setting in order to
increase the investment in and role of Australia’s regional capital cities and towns. The policies
laid down in the near future will support the expansion of regional communities and with it,
improve:
• The standard of living for many regionally based Australians;
•

Economies of scale for a wide range of projects and operations, in providing support,
infrastructure and investment in regional areas;

•

Capitalisation and promotion of technological solutions in the regions to support a
variety of industries and community support mechanisms;

Through conducting the survey of regional representatives, a range of policy suggestions were
put forward which would assist in the development of regional capitals as hubs for their region,
or policies to support regional towns to more adequately sustain their presence and improve
the economic outlook for these regions.
•

Incentivise industry investment in the regions with strategic tax and business policy;

•

Incentivise locally sourced workforce strategies by organisations with operations in
regional areas, including incentivising fly-in/fly-out and drive-in/drive-out workers to live
in their respective region of employment;

•

Tax incentives for remote living dependent on distance to metropolitan zones;

•

Investment in the development of regional centres as hubs for regional areas rather
than centralisation to the single primary metropolitan zone;

•

Modification of financial assistance grants formulas to promote development of
regional centres rather than ‘equalising’ services through grant payment;
Policies to incentivise higher education and financial assistance to cover the costs
associated regional based tertiary education; institutions could also be incentivised to
provide greater access to education opportunities, particularly in remote areas;

•

•
•

•

Access to government representative in regional centres or a return of regional state
service delivery models to the regions (e.g. Water Corp, DFES); and
Further investigation of the “City deals” initiative to ensure avenues of leveraging the
Federal Government’s commitment to regional equality are being explored resulting in
planned and coordinated investment.
Adoption of regional “buy local” policies and incentives.

Submission 110

Further to these policy improvement suggestions, a number of recommendations by the RCA
submission to the Federal Inquiry in relation to the previously mentioned “City Deals” are
relevant to policy-based strategies that the State Government should investigate. This would
enhance the initiatives of the federal government and facilitate a transition to a model which
realigns the accessibility to services and opportunities for regional Australians with
metropolitan based Australians. These recommendations are:
•

Further investigate the mapping of the service ‘hub’ role of all regional capital cities as
a matter of priority.

•

Use this information to plan and prioritise investments identified in the Government’s
development Regions 2030: Unlocking Opportunity Program and the Smart Cities –
City Deals program.

•

Highlight the importance of prioritising the delivery of the Government’s regional city
stream of City Deals to Regional Capital Cities.

•

Increase the number of regional cities to be measured under the National Cities
Performance Framework to 51 – to align with the objectives of the Smart Cities Plan
and to enable regional city deals to be measured

•

Develop a specific dataset measuring performance in all regional capital cities (of
varying populations).

(Source: Regional Capitals Australia, “Inquiry into: Indicators of, and impact of, regional
inequality in Australia SUBMISSION BY REGIONAL CAPITALS AUSTRALIA”, April
2018)
The Regional Capitals Alliance of WA have developed an Investment Framework (attached)
for improving services and infrastructure throughout regional Western Australia. Given that
the ten alliance members represent more than half of the regional population of our State, it
seems prudent to direct investment through these capitals in a “hub and spoke” manner to
address inequality of the State.
Furthermore, it is noted that the government has a long tradition of using centralisation and
decentralisation policy to demote or promote the role regional cities play in delivering services
to rural areas. This does not account for the ‘network’ that regional communities rely on for
service provision and resource sharing. Operating with centralisation policies for services does
not allow regions the opportunity to develop a self-sustaining network of support utilising the
available government support systems and other corresponding support in the same region.

ABOUT RCAWA
The Regional Capitals Alliance Western Australia (RCAWA) local governments represent the
most significant concentrations of employment in regional Western Australia. With diverse
economies and lifestyles, they offer exciting places to live, work, visit and invest.
RCAWA advocates for strategic planning for growth and investment in Western Australia’s
regional capitals.
Our Alliance is comprised of membership from City of Albany, Shire of Broome, City of
Busselton, City of Bunbury, Shire of Esperance, City of Greater Geraldton, City of KalgoorlieBoulder, City of Karratha, Shire of Northam and Town of Port Hedland.

READY FOR GROWTH & INVESTMENT
When it comes to leveraging maximum value from investment, the RCAWA members are
uniquely positioned to optimise impact. Each has a well-developed capacity – in terms of
their organisation, their community and their local industries. Combine this with their
significant business prospects; opportunities abound.
RCAWA members are adept at achieving results – even where there are many potential
obstacles. Alliance members face challenges ranging from booming populations through to
meeting the needs a vast geographic catchment operating as a service hub with a relatively
small population. Some members have seen rapid industry growth and significant
expenditure on infrastructure to accommodate this, in parallel, other Alliance members have
grappled with transitioning key industries.
What sets RCAWA members apart is their ability to proactively respond as circumstances
evolve. Alliance members provide an enabling environment where industry can develop
efficient and innovative ways of work. They build cohesive communities with quality services
and strong social fabric. Even in circumstances of geographic isolation, this has not been a
barrier to developing a thriving community and economy. Alliance members may not all
follow the same approach but are unified by their ability to recognise opportunities and
facilitate positive outcomes for their communities, with flow on benefits across the regions.

ABOUT THE REGIONAL INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK
RCAWA proposes a new approach to investment in the regions. Development of Perth as a
modern capital is important, but to achieve real growth as a State, a network of
sophisticated, well serviced regional capitals is vital. The 2017 State Budget allocates the
following investments with particular relevance to RCAWA interests (in addition to region
specific investments):
•

Innovation Fund to Drive Regional Jobs (a $16.7 million fund over four years that will support
and accelerate new and emerging businesses to diversify the Western Australian economy
and create new WA jobs and industries):
o

$4.5 million regional New Industries Fund to supercharge innovation across regional
Western Australia

o

Up to $300,000 available for projects in each region to drive job creation and
innovation

o

$1.4 million available for inter-regional innovation projects

Our Regional Investment Framework (RI Framework) centres on a focus on excellence and
opportunity making. The RI Framework proposes the development of a multi-formula
approach with a combination of merit and need-based funding pools to support strategic
growth and development in the regions. RCAWA highlights the opportunity to use the RI
Framework to inform decision making regarding the allocation of these funds marked for
investment in the regions. RCAWA advocates for the allocation of funds to allow the
strategic initiatives laid out in the RI Framework to be fully realised.
RCAWA highlights the potential to utilise this RI Framework (particularly in relation to the
theory underpinning the Regional Investment Fund) to be used as model for investment in
sectors such as education, social services and health.

Figure 1: Regional Investment Framework

Regional Investment Fund
RCAWA support the establishment of a contestable Regional Investment Fund that supports
outcomes-based initiatives. The merit criteria for such a fund should incorporate
consideration of a range of factors, as identified by the Western Australian Regional
Development Trust (WARDT) in its review of the Country Local Government Fund.
Unfortunately, the recommendations of this review were never adopted nor implemented by
the former government. Specifically, RCAWA supports criteria for funding including:
•

closer alignment between the intended outcomes of the fund and the Royalties for Regions
Act;

•

being based on the local governments’ actual infrastructure and development needs;

•

including a factor for remoteness and the vast size of some local governments;

•

taking into account DIDO and FIFO effects;

•

taking into account transient population pressures such as by tourists; and

•

taking into account economic and population growth prospects and patterns

Submission 110

On this final criterion, RCAWA suggests that
consideration is given to a model that targets
government investment in those regional communities
with the ideal combination of capability and business
prospects (see Figure 2: Capability & Prospects Matrix).
This aligns with the WARDT’s proposition in their review
that investment is focused on local government with
higher prospects and lower risk (resulting from higher
capability).
Investment in this quadrant will not only drive forward
growth in the communities who are subject to this
investment but will impact the growth of the region, and
Figure 2: Capability & Prospects Matrix
potentially the whole state. Communities with high
prospects but less capacity will be motivated to look to
the leadership of RCAWA members and other local governments in the top right quadrant for
best practice and guidance, whilst locations with high capacity and lower prospects may
choose to find a new lens to view their local context and potentially uncover unidentified
opportunities for collaboration. And where capacity and prospects are both low, these
communities may choose to partner with more developed locations to leverage value from
their expertise and opportunities.
Each of the ten member-capitals of the RCAWA were identified by the University of Western
Australia (UWA) as ‘regional capitals’ as a result of six months’ intensive research which
closely examined a range of functional and economic factors. This process involved a sound
empirical foundation, utilising a rigorous statistical method. The regional capitals were
determined by a range of factors, including population and employment, viability of urban
settlement, growth potential, location of settlement hierarchy and local characteristics.
Factors such as those identified in the UWA study, combined with opportunities in the areas
of economic development, physical infrastructure, social infrastructure, environment and
security form the basis for the determination of a capitals prospects.
Capability can be measured by the degree to which a capital is financial sustainable,
demonstrates asset planning and management best practice and undertakes transparent
and strategic financial planning and reporting.

Capacity Building Fund
A strong, capable local government sector is vital for the future growth of our state and
RCAWA is very supportive of capacity building in this sector. A needs-based assessment
approach for funding capacity building activities in the regions is supported, with
consideration given to leadership development, governance and operations.

Growth Planning Fund
Growth Plans have been developed for many of the regional capitals and are considered
valuable tools for guiding strategic and investment decision making. RCAWA advocates for
the development of Growth Plans for all capitals to enable a consistent approach to planning
for growth across each of the regional capitals.

Inquiry into the Indicators of, and Impact of Regional Inequality in Australia

Submission from Regional Capitals Alliance of WA

Page 16 of 17

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 110

RCAWA considers Growth Plans to offer an excellent opportunity for regional capitals to
identify areas of commonality and to collaborate on similar projects to leverage greater
impact from investment. A consistent methodology for growth planning across the capitals
will yield better value from investments and minimise duplication.

Voluntary Reform Fund
A focus on targeting funding to regional local governments with both prospects and
capability will naturally incentivise authorities to build capacity and take a proactive approach
to identifying real prospects. As part of this process, it is anticipated that local governments
will identify opportunities to partner, mentor, collaborate and resource share. Funding to
support this approach to voluntary reform is encouraged by RCAWA, considering that
encouraging an efficient and effective local government sector is vital to the growth of the
regions.

Regional Innovation Fund
RCAWA is keen to support innovative and entrepreneurial ecosystems in our regions. As
such, RCAWA encourages any initiative that supports innovation in the regions. The
establishment of a Regional Innovation Fund would be encouraged, particularly one that
funded:
•
•
•
•

establishment of coworking communities, innovation hubs and incubators;
services (such as training and specialist advice) that support entrepreneurship, with a
particular focus on economic gardening;
development of regional and cross-regional networks of innovators and entrepreneurs; and
access to funding for innovative ideas that balance due diligence requirements of government
and the capacity and resources of proponents to develop an application for funds.

Industry Incentive Fund
Regional Western Australia is open for business and keen to attract new industries and
enterprises to the regions. To facilitate this, the provision of an Industry Incentive Fund
(particularly with a view to developing industry clusters) to support industries and enterprises
establish in regional locations is support by RCAWA.
