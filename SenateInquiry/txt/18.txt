SUBMISSION • THE INDICATORS OF, AND IMPACT OF, REGIONAL INEQUALITY IN
AUSTRALIA
Greater Shepparton City Council writes this submission into the enquiry pertaining to 'the
indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia'.
Greater Shepparton has for many years been disadvantaged in relation to the level of
funding issued by both State and Federal Governments to support the development of
infrastructure. Reasons for this can only be envisaged as political as Greater Shepparton
has been a safe Federal and State seat for many years until recently, when the State seat
changed to an independent.
Greater Shepparton, like all regional centres has a number of challenges however
infrastructure upgrades continue to be a major stumbling block for Greater Shepparton
and the local economy. Ultimately, in order for the region to witness significant growth to
its full potential, major infrastructure upgrades are required. Passenger rail in particular
has been disappointingly under supported in relation to Greater Shepparton.
It is Council's view that an unsatisfactory passenger rail service has limited the region's
population growth, impacted the ability to keep youth within the region who often depart
from Shepparton to study away in other cities and also the potential to attract people to
the region to live, work and invest.
The below table highlights how Shepparton's growth rate has lagged behind other Local
Government Areas and regions between 2011-2016.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 18

The 'Intercity: How Regional Rail can Re-Balance population growth and create a "state of
cities" in Victoria' report outlines that with improved rail access, Greater Shepparton could
have a population approaching 150,000. The report refers to Shepparton as 'today's poor
rail relation' and confirms that the trip from Shepparton to Melbourne is now slower than
what it was in 1992.
Greater Shepparton continues to apply great effort towards enhancing the region's diverse
tourism offering. Construction of the new Shepparton Art Museum (SAM) will commence
in 2018. SAM will present a unique offering that aims to attract visitations from throughout
Australia and internationally. The region also presents an enviable major events calendar
that offers locals and visitors with the opportunity to experience Greater Shepparton's
various major event offerings which includes but isn't limited to sport, art, music, culture,
food and history. The region's extensive tourism offering however is currently undermined
by a below average passenger rail service.
The table below highlights the distances from Melbourne for Bendigo, Ballarat, Traralgon
and Shepparton and highlights the poor average speed of Greater Shepparton's rail
service and also the suboptimal average weekday services available to Greater
Shepparton.

A recent report commissioned by the Committee for Greater Shepparton titled
'Shepparton Rail Study - Comparative Analysis' outlined that based on the data within the
table below which provides a summary of Major Regional Rail Capital Projects 2002-2017,
when excluding expenditure on periodical maintenance and operations, there has been no
investment to materially improve rail services to Shepparton.

Greater Shepparton continues to advocate towards:
• a maximum 2 hour journey time between Shepparton and Melbourne;
• eight services per day, with frequent services at peak times; and
• operating speeds of 130km/h.
In order to achieve this, infrastructure improvements required to deliver the service plan
include:
• upgrading and protecting level crossings;
• line strengthening;
• securing an appropriate crossing loop
• automated signals;
• new secure stabling and servicing facilities at Shepparton; and
• suitable Vlocity rolling stock.
A modern, high quality and reliable passenger rail service would be a significant economic
game changer for Greater Shepparton. It would also assist in placing Greater Shepparton
on a level playing field with other regional centres in providing superior passenger rail
access to and from Melbourne.
As you would be aware, in 2015, the Victorian Government introduced rate capping
legislation in the form of its "Fair Go Rates System'' (FGRS). The FGRS or rate capping
introduces an annual rate cap set by the Minister for Local Government which controls
general rate increases for all councils during that financial year. The introduction of rate
capping aims to provide an assurance that ratepayers are receiving maximum value for
money. Whilst rate capping in theory aims to create efficiencies and places a set cap on
rate increases per annum, it also places Councils under incredible pressure and what is
often underestimated as a result of rate capping is the significant impact on economic
growth. In particular, a major concern as a result of the introduction of rate capping is
Council's inability to apply for State and Federal funds to support infrastructure projects
due to local government contributions required.
It is more often than not a funding requirement that Councils contribute finances towards
large infrastructure funding applications. Whilst this may seem more appropriate in a nonrate capping environment, the ability to apply for funds in the current rate capping
environment is significantly compromised.

As an example, federal funding programs such as Building Better Regions Fund
Infrastructure Projects Stream and also the 2018 Regional Growth Fund require a
financial contribution of 1: 1. Council has also been unable to apply for funding at times via
State Government streams such as 2017/18 Community Sports Infrastructure Fund which
also requires a significant financial contribution.
In March 2018, the Environment, Natural Resources and Regional Development
Committee (the Committee} tabled a report to the Victorian Parliament titled 'Inquiry into
the sustainability and operational challenges of Victoria's rural and regional councils'.
This report confirmed that councils have been required to fulfil an increasing number of
responsibilities in recent years compounded with pressures related to demographic
changes and growing community expectations. This has ultimately resulted in an increase
in annual expenditure.
The report also confirms that changes to funding arrangements, such as the freeze on
indexing Federal Financial Assistance Grants and changes in funding for jointly funded
responsibilities, has seen many regional councils experience a decline in their overall
revenue from grants in recent years.
This has been further impacted by the Victorian State Government introducing the FGRS
cap on council rate increases. For Greater Shepparton City Council specifically, modelling
of historical rate increases versus those post the introduction of the FGRS suggest lost
revenue of over $100 million over a 10 year period.
The Committee noted that the combination of increased expenditure and changes to
revenue has "made it more challenging for many of Victoria's regional councils to be
financially sustainable". Furthermore, it was highlighted that the Victorian AuditorGeneral!s-defined regional councils' finances as 'medium-risk' in the context of financial
sustainability into the future.
