Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 126

Submission to the Senate Inquiry into Regional Inequality in Australia
This paper has been prepared by Michael Bishop on behalf of and for Central Highlands
Healthcare

Introduction
Central Highlands Health was established as a charitable organisation to support primary health care
services within the Central Highlands Region of Central Queensland. Central Highlands Healthcare
received funding from the Commonwealth Department of Health to under the GP Superclinic
program to build a fit for purpose building on a green-fields site in Emerald. Central Highlands
Healthcare has been in operation for three years and has been strongly supported by the Central
Highlands Regional Council.
As a primary health care service Central highlands Healthcare has achieved considerable success and
the attached info graphic is a summary of the 2017/18 Financial Year.
The success is because people of the Central Highlands (a remote area) can access a range of
primary health care services in one place, seven days a week. Services offered include:


The indictors and impact of regional inequality in regional Australia
The literature abounds with statistics about the indicators of inequality in regional Australia. This
submission focuses on some of the detrimental aspects of rural life, however there are many
positives which will not be discussed here. Central Highlands Healthcare sees the health impact of
inequality and differential access to services. The impacts can be seen clearly by considering:






Delays in accessing appropriate diagnostic services leading to an increased severity and
complexity of health conditions
Delays in accessing specialist treatment options leading to a limitation of treatment options
Limited lifestyle choices in harsher environment
Increased health costs due to the need to travel to access both primary care and specialist
services
Poorer Health outcomes and increase in suffering as well as a loss in productivity.

To illustrate the points two de-identified case examples are used.
Case Example 1
Liz is a 43 year old woman who has had a radical mastectomy to have a suspected cancerous lump in
her breast removed. Liz had to go to Rockhampton to have the treatment and she was offered a
range of options but all required her to be away from the farm and so she chose the radical
mastectomy. Rural women are much more likely to have a radical mastectomy and have a poorer
cosmetic result because of access to follow such as breast reconstruction service not being available
locally and being very expensive.
Liz lives on a farm which supports 120 head of cattle. The farm is over an hour’s drive from Emerald
and it is struggling financially so her husband is working in a mine on a rotational roster of 10 days
on and 4 days off. His shifts are long and when he comes home he is tired but works hard with the
farm work that Liz has not been a bit to manage in his absence.
Liz and her husband have two children in primary school and Liz drives then to the bus stop each day
and picks them up so they can go to the local school.
Liz takes her young child to see the doctor because he has hurt (broken his collar bone) on the
trampoline. During the consultation her doctor asks her how she is going. Liz bursts into tears and it
is clear that her priorities are her children, next her husband, then the farm and lastly herself. She is
exhausted and has been treating a low grade urinary tract infection with home remedies and has
been experiencing headaches and dizzy spells which require further investigation. Her blood
pressure is very high.
Liz needs further assessment and follow-up but says that she can only get away from the farm every
so often. On the way out Liz makes an appointment for two months’ time.

Research has clearly shown that health professionals with a lived experience of rural and regional life
are much more likely to return to rural life as health professionals post-graduation. The
Commonwealth Department of Health has spent a considerable amount of money pursuing this
objective of building local workforce capacity as the fly-in- fly- out approach is expensive and
ultimately unsustainable except in times of great need and urgency.
Central Highlands Healthcare has a major role in supporting the local and developing workforce. An
infographic is attached to demonstrate the contribution that the organisation is making to the
medical workforce over the last year. Without a workforce with appropriate skills, experience and
ability services are not able to be provided locally. Communities also need to trust and have
confidence in their doctor and primary health care provider. Without adequate medical and primary
health care services communities become unsafe places to live.
An example of unequal access to opportunity is provided.
Case example 2
A local University accepts about 65 Central Highlands’ students into their nursing undergraduate
course each year. But by the end of the course graduate only two or three from the area. One of
these graduates is Gill. Gill made an appointment to see the CHH Practice Manager seeking work at
the end of her nursing degree. Gill expressed concern that as part of her undergraduate degree, she
had not been able to procure a clinical placement at either Emerald Hospital or Central Highlands
Healthcare in spite of placements being offered by both services, because there was not the capacity
or systems from the university to support her placements from afar. Gill was also concerned that
she was inadequate skilled to work in either setting because she was aware that nurses needed to
have a full set on clinical and practical skills to work in a rural community, that is, everyone needed
to work at the top of the scope if possible.
Gill described that she did not feel confident in any splinter skills required in the general practice,
such as wound management, vaccination, chronic disease assessment and management, ear care or
spirometry. Gill therefore could not be offered a position in the practice.
Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Professional degrees require many weeks of clinical placement
and metropolitan based students are able to live at home and be supported by their parents during
the placement. Gill had had to go away to Boarding School because her family lived in a small rural
community in the Central Highlands and the local school was not considered to be adequate to
support her ambitions of going to university. Gill’s family struggled financially to support her
academically through high school and university and Gill’s mother especially missed her daughter’s
company as she grew up. Metropolitan students do not have to leave home to access high quality
education.
It is much much harder for rural students to get into health professional courses and complete them
compared to their metropolitan counterparts.

Causes of inequality between regions, especially between capital cities and
other areas
Central Highlands Healthcare is unashamedly parochial and is vocal in supporting the central
Highlands Communities over regional centres such as Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville.
It takes strong leadership for the Hub regional centres to maintain outreach support and direct
services to Spoke communities. If there is a crisis in the centre all resources and efforts are
withdrawn back to the regional city. Outreach and dispersed services are easily identifiable and
become easy targets for budget and rationalisation. Regional centres have much easier access to
the political process which is why Central Highlands Healthcare supports the Senate for taking the
considerable effort to conduct the regional hearings.
Even though the consequences of even short term disruption of services from the centre can be
catastrophic for health and wellbeing of people who live in the Central Highlands, it happens time
and time again. The cancellation of a flight from Emerald to Brisbane (70) might mean that:







Someone misses their specialist medical appointment which they have waited months for;
A business misses an opportunity to present their case for case government funding
A lobbyist misses a meeting in Parliament House
A doctor misses their professional development opportunity
Someone’s parent dies in Palliative care without saying goodbye
A lost holiday weekend

Central highlands people manage the inconsistencies of travel by given up their time. They arrive
the day earlier and stay overnight or two nights or drive the 10 hours to the city.
There are economic and social costs to unreliable infrastructure including airports, roads, trains and
information and communication technology. Central highlands people pay a premium to participate
at a state, national and global level.
Is there a consideration of the economic powerhouse that the Central Highlands provide to State
and National coffers or multinational company profits?

Analysis of economics of regional inequality, including wider impacts
Rural communities require a reliable source of workers to support a range of industries from farming
to mining for electricity generation to social services. Fly-in-fly-out processes are expensive and
unsustainable over time leading to a drain on regional areas. Workforce aged adults are likely to
have children so birthing services, health care, education and aged care service must be provided.
Maintaining basic health services according to need is a significant issue to the Central Highlands
with communities such as the Gemfields and Capella as recent examples where inadequate
healthcare has led to vocal dissatisfaction and disaffection. Statistics from the emerald hospital
clearly show that patients from these communities are traveling considerable distance stoa cess

basic care. Infrastructure is either lacking or poorly maintained and neither the public nor private
sectors can be adequately remunerated to provide a consistent and adequate service.
This means that productivity is decreased and the flexibility to respond to national and global market
fluctuations is lessened.
Travel is expensive and it is made worse by poor roads, road works (as there is no alternative route)
and price gouging by fuel companies. All transport services come at a premium in the bush whether
it is to deliver sock, cotton, grain, coal, furniture or building supplies.
Airfares to and from Emerald are structured to exploit fly-in-fly-out services and are not consistent
(nearly three times the cost if you leave Fridays and return Mondays).

Examples of solutions: which has caused some regions and towns to prosper?
“Necessity is the mother of invention” and “success breeds success” are two statements which can
be applied to the Central Highlands generally and to Central Highlands Healthcare specifically.
Even though there is so much disadvantage, inequality and inequity there is a feeling a resilience and
hope across the Central Highlands. This hopefulness and optimism is expressed by the patients who
access the range of services provided by our organisation. We have leadership from our local
businesses and Regional Council. Our local members of parliament are accessible and fairly
response (nothing to do with being a marginal seat). The Central Highlands is already and could be
even more a net economic contributor to the nation’s coffers.
Innovation needs to be acknowledged and supported and the whole community engaged and
invited to participate. Central Highlands’ communities have experienced this success through times
of crisis in the primary industries, drought, and flood and in the resources boom and decline.

Policy settings which could help address inequality between regions
Grants for infrastructure in a planned and sustainable way are critical and the Northern Australia
platform is just the most recent policy initiative to highlight a way forward.
Some regional areas due to their political stability are ignored when opportunities for affirmative
action are ignored. A bipartisan approach is required from political leaders so that momentum is
maintained and not epileptic in implementation.

In our experience the following are key





Sustained affirmative action
Considered infrastructure
Grants to support innovation
Grants to build infrastructure of social services
