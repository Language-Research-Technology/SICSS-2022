FOREWORD

P

ride. Compassion. Strength. These are the key themes
that rose to the top of our discussions with residents
of Tasmania’s North West and Western regions.

Pride in their history, their beautiful environment, their
achievements as a community. Pride in each other, their
resilience and connectedness.
Compassion for those doing it as tough or tougher than
themselves. And insight into the need for communities
like theirs to lift all members up by coming together and
finding effective solutions.
And strength. Time and again those we spoke with or who
responded to our online survey in this region highlighted
the connectedness of their communities—connections
with each other, with family, friends, communities, with
local history and their surrounding environment.
And all of this adds up to trust—in an active and
actioned belief that the things that hold this region and
its people together are stronger than any differences or
circumstances that may try to tear them apart.
Through this project we also found ideas, solutions
and a sense that things need to change and be done
differently if we are to improve the lives of every
community member.
Health, education, employment and safety: these were
all cited as priority concerns. But not in a context of
whining—in a context of ‘We can fix this. We can propel
change for the better.’

TASCOSS: VOICES OF OUR REGIONS NORTH WEST AND WEST

And as would be expected in a part of our State with a
higher than average number of children being born into
poverty, long-term, entrenched unemployment, many
transportation gaps and poor educational attainment,
there was great concern for the future.
Although residents know they can count on others within
the community if they fall on particularly hard times,
there is a strong desire to prevent those hard times
from ever arising—to model respectful relationships,
encourage academic achievement and ensure work
wasn’t just available but was meaningful for those who
call this region home.
It is tricky to single out community service organisations
in this region because they are such an integrated
part of its communities. Community development and
emergency relief agencies were referred to time and
again as a vital and trusted member of the fabric of
this region—providing assistance, support and building
capacity throughout.
Pride. Compassion. Strength.
What leader wouldn’t take the time to speak, listen and
learn from the people who know the North West and West
best: the people who sit there, solutions in hand, eager
for the support needed to change their communities for
the better.

ABOUT THE REGION

The North West and West region includes the local
government areas of Burnie, Central Coast, Circular
Head, Devonport, Kentish, King Island, Latrobe,
Waratah-Wynyard, and West Coast.

T

he North West and West makes up approximately 22%
of Tasmania’s population.* The region’s population is
slightly older than that of Tasmania overall; it
also has a higher proportion of people that identify as
Aboriginal than the state as a whole.
The electorate of Braddon, which encompasses much
of the region, falls into the second-highest quintile
of personal well-being among electorates in Australia
in a survey that measures people’s satisfaction with
the quality of their lives. Braddon has a score of 76.95
compared to a national average of 76.9.
TasCOSS visited three communities in the North
West and West: Shorewell Park in Burnie, Smithton,
and Rosebery. We chose these communities as part of
a Tasmania-wide selection process, on the basis of a
matrix that included:

King Island

Smithton
Burnie
Circular

We spoke with 29 residents of the North West
and West at the following locations:

Wyndarra Centre, Smithton

Levels of unemployment, both current and over time

Burnie Neighbourhood House, Shorewell Park

Presence/absence of health services

Rosebery Neighbourhood House

We also conducted an on-line survey that attracted 13
respondents from the North West and West region.

IN THEIR OWN WORDS

The importance of community
Most participants in all three locations were proud to live
in a lovely part of the state. As one participant said:
I love being here. This is my home.
I’m stamping my feet on it and saying ‘it’s mine’.

In all three locations, participants spoke of the pleasure
of living in a beautiful environment in which they could
connect with nature. They also appreciated the region’s
low population pressures and gentle pace of life, which
gives people the time to connect with family, to form
strong friendships, and to engage in activities they
described as nurturing, such as growing their own food.
Gardening is simple. You water and weed – amazing

In particular, all participants praised their local
Neighbourhood Houses, including the volunteers who
work there, for their warmth and support, as well as for
their part in building community pride. Some said that
local employers (for example, the mine in Rosebery) have
also shown strong community spirit.
At their best, participants in all three locations said,
small communities have some great attributes. In
particular, several participants noted that beyond strong
connections between friends and family, services in small
communities have the ability to connect with their clients
more deeply than might be the case in a larger, more
anonymous setting. Some praised local businesses that
have been willing to go the extra mile for those in need.
We’re all humans [here]…We’re not a number.

to watch. You watch how plants grow and you have
hope for yourself that you can grow.

Several people suggested that these factors underpin
the community spirit found across the region, and the
pride that local residents feel in their communities.
Particularly in Burnie, participants suggested that local
efforts to build community spirit are having positive
effects.
The [local] park is improving, feels safer, and there
is greater community pride…There is a stigma
attached to Shorewell, [but] this is shifting. We like
to feel proud of being a ‘Shorewellian.’

The challenges for people
doing it tough
Although participants loved many things about their
lives, they also were faced with challenges. These
covered a wide range of issues—income, employment,
education, housing, health, transport, and safety—
including how they affect children in the region.
(What worries me is) …lack of permanency in jobs,
cost of living, access to services, how my children
will ever afford to buy a house.

In the three locations, all participants said that the
people around them were what they valued the most
about their community. Many spoke of the willingness of
their local community to come together in tough times,
and praised the volunteers who operate across the
community to help others in need.
If [all the volunteers] stopped, Circular Head
couldn’t keep going.

INCOME

D

espite pockets of prosperity, the North West and West
is not a wealthy region. Half of North West and
West’s residents earn less than $40,000 a year;
this is 2.6% lower than the median income for Tasmania,
and is 11% lower than the Australian median income.
With the exception of the West Coast, the region has
a higher proportion than the Tasmanian average of
disability support pensioners, and a higher proportion
of the region’s older residents rely on the aged pension.
Residents of the region who can’t find a job are also more
likely than the state average to remain unemployed for
longer than six months. As a consequence, surveys have
found that a higher proportion of people living in the
region were unable to raise $2000 within two days in
case of emergency than the state average.
All participants appeared to live modestly, and several
stressed that they did their best to manage their money
well and to live frugally and self-reliantly. However,
most were doing it tough financially. This reflects the
difficulties of finding secure, adequate employment, as
well as the gap that has emerged between the levels of
Federal assistance programs (Newstart, the disability
and aged pensions, Commonwealth Rent Assistance) and
cost of living.
Key spending pressures included the price of
private rentals and the cost of food, utilities, and
telecommunications; some also noted the impact of big
occasional bills such as car registration. Many said that
they had accessed help from family, friends, emergency
relief services and their local Neighbourhood Houses.
A number of participants appreciated financial literacy
training and initiatives that help people make their
income go farther by bartering of goods and services.

Median household income:
North West and West: $39,694
Tasmania: $40,749
National: $44,940
Proportion of the population 16-64 who are
disability support pensioners:
North West and West: 10.1%

Learning about how to save money and spend what
we have well has really helped... There is also a new
program called CENTS, where you can trade skills or
things that other people might want to buy. This is a
great idea, as it doesn’t affect Centrelink.

CHILDREN

Children in disadvantage
As in Tasmania as a whole, the impact of the North
West and West’s low incomes is disproportionately
concentrated on the region’s children: some 30% of the
region’s children live in low-income families, and 20%
live in jobless families. Burnie-Ulverstone in particular
has a higher-than-state-average proportion both of
children living in low-income families and of singleparent families; these two figures are often correlated
due not only to the lack of two incomes in a family, but
also lower average individual incomes for single parents.
A significantly higher-than-state-average proportion of
the region’s children also live in households where the
mother’s education did not go above Year 10—a fact
that is significant because low parental educational
attainment often contributes to lower family incomes.
Parents among the participants emphasised that they
did their best to ensure that their children are buffered
from deprivation: a few, for instance, said that the
parents always made sure that their children had healthy
food to eat. But their care came with a cost: sometimes
they had to miss meals themselves.
Meanwhile, participants noted that where most local
activities come with a price tag, children from lowincome families can miss out on participating in many
forms of entertainment and stimulation.

Some participants noted that the risks associated with
boredom grow as children get older.
There’s not much for teenagers to do. Teenagers are
left to their own devices or they go and hang out
with the adults, something like that. A lot of time
when there is something to do, it ends up being
something illegal.

Child protection
Several participants called for more help for children
having problems at home and those living on the street,
in the forms both of better family support and in better
out-of-home alternatives where necessary. A few also
noted the need for violence prevention across the
community.

There needs to be something for kids and youth to
do that doesn’t always cost money. There is laser tag
and the cinema etc., but they cost money. The skate
park is free but it is not suitable for young children,
it’s not safe because of some of the older kids.

EMPLOYMENT

A

lower proportion of people in the North West and
West are unemployed than in Tasmania as a whole
While the region’s participation rate in January
2017 was slightly below the Tasmanian average, the
3,000 people in the region out of work represented
only 20% of the total number of people unemployed
in the state, compared with the region’s 22% of the
state’s population. Meanwhile, youth unemployment in
the region in January 2017 was 3.2% lower than the
Tasmanian rate overall.
Nevertheless, unemployment in the region remains
high. As of the September quarter of 2016, West Coast
had the highest level of unemployment by LGA for
the region at 8.1%, followed by Devonport; BurnieWivenhoe was the local area with the highest rate at
10.6%, followed closely by Acton-Upper Burnie and East
Devonport.
Unemployment preyed on the minds of most
participants in all three communities.
Employment is really big – once you get out of
school it’s huge. There aren’t many jobs.

In their discussions, participants focussed as much
on the sense of self-worth that comes from stable,
rewarding employment as the increased level of
financial security that employment offers. Meanwhile,
underemployment was also a concern to many
participants. Even those who were employed spoke about
the inconsistent nature of their employment and their
need for more hours, and more regular hours.
Money is a constant worry. A reliable job can be
hard to find, and particularly one that makes you
feel good about yourself.

Nevertheless, participants in Burnie in particular had
strong feelings about the importance of balancing
economic growth with environmental concerns.
In the 1960s and ‘70s Burnie was a stinking
industrial joint, but everyone had a job. Burnie as
a city now has never looked better but there are
no jobs…We certainly don’t want to go back to
destructive industries.

Participants in all communities spoke about the need
for more secure, adequate employment opportunities,
particularly for local young people.
Youth unemployment leads to drugs leads to crime
leads to violence leads to the Justice system.

HOUSING

H

ousing is comparatively affordable in the North West
and West, with a higher proportion of dwellings
in the region that are social housing than elsewhere
in the state. As a consequence, the proportion of lowincome households in the region suffering from overall
housing stress (rental and mortgage) is lower than that
for the state as a whole. Still, only 12% of dwellings in
the region are affordable to households on government
income support. Furthermore, possibly because lowerincome buyers have been attracted to the West Coast
and Devonport because of lower than average property
prices, a higher than average proportion of mortgages
in these areas are to lower-income people who are
suffering financial stress as a consequence of buying.
Most participants said that they appreciated the
region’s comparatively low housing costs and the
availability of social housing, although a few Burnie
residents expressed concerns at the condition of the
Housing Tasmania stock there. Many participants spoke
of owning a home as their dream, even though most
feared that it was out of reach unless they were able to
secure stable, adequate employment.

At the same time, participants on the West Coast
commented that the affordability of housing in that
area makes it very risky to relocate to another town for
employment, as they feared that they wouldn’t be able to
afford adequate housing in another region.
The difference in the prices of rents away from here
are too high. We can’t relocate.

Even those participants who owned property worried
about the future, wondering if they would be able to stay
in their homes or how their children would ever afford to
buy a house.
We worry that the money we’ve saved will not be
sufficient to allow us to maintain our home and our
contacts with family (in retirement).

It might not ever happen for us but owning a home
would be an amazing thing. A stable job that pays a
fair wage would need to be the first thing, otherwise
the banks won’t even look as us.

TRANSPORT

O

utside of Burnie and Devonport, where Metro and
Merseylink provide local services, the North West and
West are poorly served by public transport, with
buses from Rosebery to Burnie running only two days
a week. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a smaller-than-stateaverage proportion of dwellings in the region have no
motor vehicle.
Transport emerged as an important issue in all
communities, with participants concerned about limits to
routes, and timetables, as well as the cost of fares.
There are no buses on Sunday. The public transport
between towns is very expensive. You are stuck in
Burnie and can’t afford to get out.

People trying to use public transport to travel between
communities in the region, rather than going on through
to Launceston or Hobart, face particular challenges—an
issue that affects employment.
The majority of jobs are in Strahan which is

Mothers in particular noted the difficulties faced by
people who are dealing with heavy loads or young children
when trying to use busses, particularly when there are
no footpaths. Participants in all three communities spoke
of the importance of better footpaths and cycleways to
enable people to get around without a car.
Transport has been very difficult. With my first
baby I relied on public transport and would walk 30
minutes or more rather than catch a bus, as it was
so difficult to get prams in and out when travelling
by myself. If I had to go into town I would get a
friend to come with me or meet me there to help me
off the bus.

People on the North West Coast appear to pay about
the same, or a little less, for petrol than Hobart and
Launceston residents; West Coast information is
not updated frequently enough to make accurate
comparisons.

hard for people who don’t drive.

Some participants also raised the issue of limited
eligibility for community transport.
We do have…cars that run us to Burnie but in the
middle of the night you can’t ring someone and ask
them to organise a lift for you. And some people
can’t use them – only for pensioners, not for people
on Newstart allowance.

EDUCATION

A

higher proportion (substantially higher, in the case
of the West Coast) of North West and West
Coast residents left school at year 10 or below than
in Tasmania as a whole. Additionally, around 70% of the
region’s primary schools have a disproportionate number
of children from low-socio-economic backgrounds.
Students who live in the North West and West are less
likely to be participating full time in secondary school
education at the age of 16 than Tasmanian children
as a whole, particularly in Burnie/Ulverstone; they are
also less likely to be learning or earning at ages 15-19,
particularly on the West Coast. And even when they are
enrolled, they do not necessarily appear to be attending:
in total, six schools in the area (17% of all schools) had
90% attendance rates of under 60% in 2015.
Most participants appeared to appreciate the quality
of education offered by the region’s public schools.
I value our good public school system.

Participants in all four communities expressed concern
about the capacity of teachers to maintain discipline
in classrooms and provide dedicated assistance to
those students that needed more support. In particular,
participants across the four communities described a
pattern of children being placed on part-time timetables
as early as kinder and prep in primary school. According
to the MySchool website, around 5% of the region’s
primary school students appear to have been on parttime timetables in 2015, with individual school levels
ranging to as high as 8.8%.
Sometimes the move to a part-time timetable was
described as being due to “disruptive behaviour,”
which parents felt teachers could be better equipped to
address in a supportive fashion.
My oldest son suffered trauma as a small child. The
teachers don’t know what to do with him. I can’t get
support for him in the school system. They have no
trauma training. He’s 7 years old, but when he gets

But two, often inter-related issues emerged in all
communities in relation to education: exclusion and
bullying.
Participants in all four communities expressed
concerns about the ability of the education system to
cope with children who require extra support, whether
educational or behavioural. This is not a small problem:
in 2015, a substantial proportion of children in the North
West and West region showed signs that they might
require extra support once they went into school (as
assessed by vulnerability in early childhood). In some
local government areas, this proportion was 25% or
more. In a few communities, it was above 40%, with 2431% almost certain to require extra support if they were
to remain engaged in the classroom and learn effectively.

doing that.

In other instances, however, schools appear to be putting
children who have been subjected to bullying on part-time
timetables rather than resolving the bullying itself.

SAFETY

T

he North West and West is generally a safe region,
with residents feeling safer and more confident in
the police and with lower rates of most types of
major crime (with the exception of property damage)
than the Tasmanian average.
Although, as noted above, participants appreciated
the many many advantages of smaller tight-knit
communities, they observed that there is a flip side
to this intimacy: “you can’t sneeze without the whole
town knowing.” At the personal level, a number of
participants in all three locations spoke of experiences
of bullying, exclusion and ostracism. These included
instances of bullying by local children of a person with
mental illness, exclusion of a child with disabilities,
violence and hostility toward a gay man and his mother,
and shunning of the mother of a man currently in gaol.
These and similar issues appeared to impact greatly on
participants’ individual perceptions of safety.
In fact, safety and public order emerged strongly in all
three communities, revolving around a few major themes.

Young people
Participants in all three communities were concerned
about antisocial and illegal behaviour among young
people. Indeed, in Tasmania Police’s Western region a
higher proportion of most categories of crime—nearly
double in relation to some offenses, like car theft—were
committed by young people than is the case across the
state as a whole.
I know kids in grade 5 and 6 that are already
in trouble with the law.

There was a sense by some participants that the more
traditional methods of disciplining children had not yet
been replaced with effective alternatives. Similarly, many
felt that more training and support could be provided to
teachers to assist them in addressing discipline issues
at school. The situation is made worse, many suggested,
by the absence of activities for children and young
people, particularly teenagers, which results in boredom
and can lead to anti-social behaviour.
With the exception of car theft, much of the behaviour
by young people that particularly worried participants
was of a public order rather than criminal nature-noise, targeted littering, hooning, throwing rocks
at roofs, or aggressive comments. These kinds of
behavior, participants said, make community members—
particularly women and girls—feel unsafe.
The young boys say terrible things to the young
girls—they use really bad words—and they do it over
and over again.

A few participants noted that better modelling from
adults, including a crackdown on family violence, will be
necessary if these kinds of behaviours are to change.
It’s hard to teach safe relationships at schools when
the whole town needs a kick up the arse and to
learn the lesson.
Educating young people to stand up to violence is
paramount.

Drugs
Particularly but not exclusively in Burnie, participants
were also worried by the impact of drugs on their
communities. On the one hand, participants emphasised
that many drug users are prisoners of their habits and
need help rather than punishment. At the same time,
participants in all three communities took a very hard
line towards drug dealers.
We need a rehab facility here so that people can
get help. There is a very long waiting list for the
facilities we have.

P18 of 32

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 96 - Attachment 1

Policing
Against the backdrop of these safety concerns, a number
of themes around current policing practices emerged.
Participants felt that there had been a move away from
community policing and lessening of police presence
and engagement in communities as part of a decline in a
wide range of services and support.
Many felt that the policing approach to stopping
crime has narrowed to drive-through surveillance, at the
expense of serving as a continuous reassuring presence
or responding to incidents that make people feel unsafe.
Many also expressed a belief that police were targeting
some communities for fines, for instance by waiting near
the entrances to social housing areas and spot-checking
for licenses and registration.
People said, these perceptions lead to mistrust and
resentment towards police, which affects the whole
community badly—especially children.
Kids have no one to turn to that they can trust.
The police should work with the community, not
against it.

A few participants also put in a special plea to bring
responses to violence against parents by children,
particularly adult children, into line with domestic
violence responses, saying that it is a terrible
emotional burden for a parent to have to take out an AVO
against a child.
Police don’t get family violence by kids.

HEALTH

T

he North West and West are comparatively wellserved with medical facilities, with regional,
community or district hospitals in Burnie, Latrobe,
Smithton and Queenstown. Nevertheless, compared to
Tasmanians as a whole, people in the North West and
West are:
At a higher risk of fair-to-poor health, especially in
Burnie/Ulverstone.
At a higher risk of psychological distress, especially in
Burnie/Ulverstone.
More likely to be physically disabled, especially in
Burnie/Ulverstone.
More likely to die prematurely, especially on the West Coast.
More likely to smoke, especially in Burnie/Ulverstone.
More likely to consume risky amounts of alcohol,
especially in Burnie/Ulverstone.
More likely to be obese, especially on the West Coast.

Participants across the three communities noted long
waiting lists for specialists, and the need to travel long
distances to see them. Participants in Rosebery also
noted the lack of local palliative care facilities.
When my husband was dying, at the time,
I was grateful that the hospital wards were open.
But shortly after he died the wards closed.
Now people have to go to Burnie when they
are in palliative care.

Some participants said that staff at major health care
facilities in the region were sometimes insensitive to the
long distances that people have to travel for care and
the challenges of arranging transport if patients can’t
drive themselves.
I’ve heard of people going to Burnie in the
ambulance and being discharged at night
because the hospital needs the bed
[with no one coordinating transport].
And they know that they’re from this area.

While life spans in the North West and West overall are
similar to Tasmanians as a whole, West Coasters are
likely to die four years younger than other Tasmanians.
Our biggest challenge is keeping people
healthy physically and mentally.

Many participants across the three communities were
happy with local health services—provided that they
were able to access them. Many spoke of long waits to
access a local GP, as well as the difficulty of establishing
relationships with GPs who only stay in the community
for short periods of time.
We don’t have doctors every day—they are on rotation
and on different days...You go and see one doctor, and
then you go back a few weeks later and you get told a
completely different thing. And you have to retell the
whole story again.

I have a sister in Smithton.
She went into labour at 4 am and the hospital told
her to drive through the Burnie. She has two other
kids. They finally got to Burnie at 7 am, and the
people there tried to ask her to go back to Smithton.
But she didn’t.

A number of participants called strongly for better
mental health services in the region.
People get stuck for various reasons and often
help isn’t there and they can’t help themselves.
Especially with things like…depression…The avenue
to find help needs to be easier than turning to drugs,
[but] at the moment that’s not the case.

A few online survey respondents also urged better
disability services in the region, with one particularly
calling for improved respite services for younger people
with disabilities.

GETTING HEARD

A

n unanticipated theme that emerged strongly
was frustration at feeling unheard by all levels of
government. Across the region, participants
complained that state-level politicians rarely visit their
neighbourhoods or ask for their opinions about either the
problems that they face, or possible solutions to these
problems. Similarly, many said that local governments
do not effectively seek out the views of their residents
on key issues such as infrastructure spending. As a
result, participants said, ordinary people feel that their
knowledge, experience and opinions are not valued, and
that they do not have a role to play in achieving change
or planning for the future in their local areas.

Participants in Rosebery in particular said that
government actions taken without community
consultation are often counterproductive for
communities: for example, when services are pulled out,
people have to leave.
Services are being lost all the time—it’s a major
disincentive for people staying in the area…A lot of
people are leaving because of schools.

People actually coming out and talking with us
like you are doing would help.
[To politicians] Come and visit. Spend a week. Step into
someone else’s shoes…Engage in community chats,
street by street...Talk to kids themselves.

SMITHTON THROUGH MY EYES

Sue Popowski, a long-term resident of Smithton,
has provided us with a short, personal view of
Smithton and its history.

M

y family moved to a small soldier settlement farm at
Togari in the late 1960s. It was a small community
that regularly gathered at the community hall. We
had 85 cows, which was enough to keep a family. All the
cows had names and were treated like pets. Now farms
are larger acreage and are run by corporations, and
families generally find it hard to own their own farms;
they’re employed as share farmers or managers.
In the ‘70s and ‘80s Smithton was booming—everyone
had a job. I remember that I could walk into any
employment I wanted. There were head offices, which
meant that there were managers and senior staff and
families that lived in the area. Technology changed all
this—there are only a couple of head offices now, with
many people travelling into town when required. Farmers
are now using robots for milking. McCain no longer
process vegetables here, just potatoes. This has led to
the loss of a lot of jobs mostly for women, and that’s
had an effect on local retailers—women brought in that
second income.
Over the years, Smithton has had to learn to adapt. Our
traditional industries have been rationalised. But we’re
not ones to give up. Smithton was built on the timber
industry, with many sawmills dotted around the district.
Now there are only two mills but the minor species
veneers—blackwood, sassafras—are much sought after.
The famous Duck River butter is now made in Devonport,
but over 50% of the state’s milk comes from Circular
Head, and now have two factories which process milk.
Very high quality products are produced in the region.
We ship abalone, oysters, crayfish, and local grass-fed
Cape Grim and Robbins Island Wagyu beef overseas; Cape
Grim rainwater is some of the purest in the world. Even
the local butcher in Smithton has won awards for his

TASCOSS: VOICES OF OUR REGIONS NORTH WEST AND WEST

sausages and ham, and the local baker for their pies.
Some changes have affected the way the community
comes together. Team sports—football, netball and
hockey in the winter, softball and cricket in the summer—
used to be a big part of life here. If you played one sport,
you usually played a couple, and you were expected to
give back by being on committees, umpiring or scoring.
Even though the traditional sports are still played,
now people are doing more individual sports like bike
riding and bushwalking, as well as sports that rely on
equipment for which you have to go to Burnie. I feel that
one reason families move away from Smithton is that
they’re spending so much time driving kids to Burnie for
after-school activities.
The community is still really strong. If there is ever a
crisis in the district, you can bet that everyone will pull
together, whether it be floods or bushfires—yes, we have
had both. People rallied to raise money for the aged care
facility, and now we are once again raising money to help
fund a pool. This Australia Day we saw a local lady swim
from Stanley to Smithton to raise funds. When she swam
up the Duck River towards the crowd, there was so much
cheering, people were so proud that tears were falling—a
massive effort.
There are many people who have lived in Smithton and
moved away for various reasons—however, most will say
that the years in our town and the district were some of
their best.

COMMUNITY IN FOCUS: SMITHTON

P

articipants at Smithton expressed the same sense of
community connection that came through in all the
meetings. Indeed, many said that the whole Circular
Head community is a tight-knit one, and that people rally
around when individuals or the community are in times
of need. As noted earlier, many participants particularly
praised the community’s volunteers, who play a
significant role throughout the region; a few also said
that acting as volunteers brought them social contact as
well as a positive feeling of being helpful to people in the
community who are isolated.
Although Smithton is isolated, participants
appreciated the presence of a reasonable number of
services in the community, including the hospital, good
GPs, aged care facilities and services, and community
transport. One resident had indeed relocated to Smithton
because the situation there is –
...much better than the West Coast,
where services are non-existent.

Income and child disadvantage
Smithton’s median income is slightly higher than that
for Tasmania. A lower proportion of the population than
regionally or Tasmania-wide are on disability benefits,
but a higher proportion of older people receive the aged
pension. A smaller proportion of Smithton residents
receive unemployment benefits long-term. A lower
proportion of Smithton’s children live in low-income,
jobless or single-parent families than the state average.
By contrast, Smithton has a sharply higher than stateor regional-average proportion of children living in
households where their mother did not go to school
beyond Year 10.
Smithton participants noted that low income levels are
particularly problematic where children are concerned,
since many popular recreational activities for children
come with a significant cost; as a result, they said,
children from low income families are excluded, which
leads to boredom and trouble in the end. One parent also
wished for more support for children with disabilities,
who can be excluded from recreational activities as well.
Several participants said that violence against
children is a problem in Smithton, which interventions by
child protection services do not always solve.

Everyone we spoke to in Smithton
spoke of the resilience and community spirit of the
entire Circular Head region, which stretches west
from the ‘Sisters Hills’ through Stanley
and Smithton to Marrawah and south to the
Pieman River. In fact, people we spoke to
were more likely to refer to themselves as being
from Circular Head than from a particular town.

We are tight-knit across the
whole Circular Head community.

Employment
A smaller proportion of people in Smithton are
unemployed than in the North West and West and in
Tasmania as a whole—a total of around 110 people as of
January 2017.
Smithton participants spent less time than those
in other communities discussing issues around
employment, but one observed that –
…12-hour shifts leave parents with
no time to spend with their children.

Education
A notably higher proportion of Smithton residents had
left school at Year 10 or below than either their West
Coast or Tasmanian counterparts. Smithton children
are less likely to be participating full time in secondary
school education at age 16 than either their regional
counterparts or the Tasmanian average; a slightly
higher proportion than for the West Coast as a whole are
earning or learning at ages 15-19 than their West Coast
counterparts, but a lower proportion than in Tasmania as
a whole.
Smithton participants were generally supportive of
the local educational system, but some noted that
classes were too big and staff too few to provide extra
time, support and care to children whose behaviour
is disruptive or who are falling behind. This last point
stands out, given that in 2015, 25.9% of Smithton
children—notably higher than the Tasmanian average—
showed signs that they might require extra support
once they went to school, with 12.1% almost certain to
require extra support if they were to remain engaged in
the classroom and learn effectively. In fact, in Term 3 of
2015, Smithton Primary School’s 90% attendance rate
was just over 60%, and Smithton High School’s was 51%.

Housing
A lower percentage of households in Smithton receive
rent assistance than for the region as a whole or
Tasmania overall. A lower proportion of Smithton’s
low-income households are in financial stress from
mortgages or rent than in Tasmania as a whole, a fact
that may reflect in part the fact that a higher dwellings
there than in Tasmania as a whole, and a much higher
proportion than in the public-housing-poor West Coast,
are affordable (social) rental housing properties. Housing
indeed did not emerge as a strong theme in the Smithton
meeting, although one participant noted long waits for
maintenance of public housing properties.

Safety
Participants said that Smithton definitely has a tough
end of town where drugs, petty theft and family violence
are frequent concerns. As in Burnie, a few participants
noted that the entire north coast is vulnerable to drugs
coming across Bass Strait in private vessels, with the
result that the community faces “every variety [of drug]
going” as well as higher levels of burglary associated

with drug use. Some participants felt particularly
intimidated by violence associated with drug dealing; a
few said that they often avoided going outside for fear of
witnessing something that could get them in trouble with
drug dealers. However, a few participants emphasised
that diversion, rather than imprisonment, is the best way
to deal with young drug users.

Transport
Smithton is transport-poor, with one bus service a day
running to and from Burnie, from which it is possible
to catch four services a day to Hobart via Devonport
and Launceston. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the rate of
households with no motor vehicle is below the Tasmanian
average, although still well above the rest of the West
Coast. One participant was proud to be a driver for
community transport, saying that his and the service’s
efforts are crucial for isolated members of
the community.
While Smithton information is not updated frequently
enough to make accurate comparisons, residents
appear to pay a little more for petrol than other
residents in the region.

Health
A powerful testimony to the community spirit
of the Circular Head area is the local residential
aged care facility, Emmerton Park.
First established in the 1960s, the facility has
twice been significantly expanded through
community activism and donations
—most recently in the 2000s, when the Circular Head
community raised over $900,000 in just 12 months towards a
purpose-built 60-bed nursing facility at the site, with an
additional $1.4m coming from Circular Head Council.
The facility won the 2013 National Aged Care
Organisation Award—the highest honour
in Australian aged care—and is strongly
supported through the dedication
of local volunteers.

SMITHTON

In particular, Smithton’s premature mortality rates are
very high. The town’s rates of premature death from
cancer are over 30% higher than Tasmania’s; from
lung cancer, over 40% higher; from circulatory system
diseases, 130% higher; from heart disease, 90% higher;
from cerebrovascular disease, 167% higher; from
respiratory diseases, 46% higher; and from external
causes, 22% higher. Primary Health Tasmania profiles
show that most of Smithton’s services are dedicated to
chronic disease management.
Most Smithton participants did not address health
directly in their comments, a fact that may reflect the
comparatively good services described above. However,
participants warmly supported initiatives related to
the social determinants of health, such as community
gardens and increased support for families.

suggested that politicians and bureaucrats visit the
town and spend some time with the community in order
to better understand local issues and seek out local
solutions. One participant stated that organisations that
are funded to provide services to the Circular Head area
often do not actually come into the area.
When will government realise that the people on the
ground are the people who have answers to some of the
issues. Government should consult, not insult.

We heard many stories of the power of volunteering
in the Circular Head community, and of the benefits both
to the community and to volunteers themselves.
From drivers of community transport to volunteer gardeners
to people helping community residents with disabilities get
out of the house, volunteers brought good things to the lives
of others, often while gaining strength themselves during
hard times. Sporting groups, emergency services, Rotary,
church and community groups—all play their part in building
connections in the community.

It is amazing to see the different kinds of
people that pull together. It brings everyone
to the same level.
