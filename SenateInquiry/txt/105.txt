Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 105

Mr Mark Fitt
Committee Secretary
Senate Economics References Committee
Parliament House
Canberra, ACT 2600
21 May 2018
Dear Mr Fitt,
Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission to the committee’s Inquiry into the
indicators of, and impact of, regional inequality in Australia. The Australia Institute is a
Canberra-based public policy think tank, with a wide range of research interests including
inequality and regional development.
While the causes of regional inequality are many and complex, the policy response is often
simplistic – build big, capital-intensive infrastructure projects. This is perhaps best
demonstrated by the Adani coal project. While Adani’s own economist has told courts that
large coal mines have a minimal impact on employment, the project’s supporters push for
government subsidy on the basis of jobs and regional development.
While Adani is in the headlines in 2018, there is a long history of project beneficiaries pushing
for government assistance under the guise of regional economic development, but failing to
deliver the promised public benefit. For example, the Ord River Irrigation Scheme has
received over $2 billion in mainly public investment over decades, yet has not driven
population growth and economic equality for the East Kimberley. The last expansion saw
over $300 million of public subsidy result in just 60 extra jobs.
A new research report by The Australia Institute compares the local government areas of
East and West Kimberley. The two areas are similar in area, population, climate and
landscape, but differ in that East Kimberley has a large irrigation scheme. Despite this,
employment in the two areas is very similar. Agriculture is 9% of employment in the East and
6% in the West. Recent growth in agricultural employment has been similar in both areas.
The key point is that capital-intensive projects, such as coal mines or large-scale irrigation, do
not drive regional development. Such projects may bring billions in investment, but they
employ relatively few people and are likely to make a minimal contribution to reducing
regional inequality. Instead, government investment should focus on making regional
communities places that people want to stay in or move to. This investment should reduce
inequality, support communities and focus on providing services such as transport, health,
education and communications.

Irrigation and jobs in the Kimberley
Promotion of large-scale irrigation in the West
Kimberley ignores the lessons of the East Kimberley.
Census data shows that despite huge public subsidy
in Ord irrigation, the major employers in both
regions are health, education and services. Tourism,
carbon farming, renewable energy and high-value
niche agriculture are also avenues of potential
development.

Summary
Plans to promote irrigated agriculture in the West Kimberley should be assessed in
light of experience in the neighbouring East Kimberley which has the Ord River
scheme. Despite decades of effort in the Ord, $2 billion dollars invested including huge
public subsidy, thousands of hectares cleared and huge amounts of water used, census
employment data shows the employment structure of the two areas is very similar. In
both, the largest employing industries are health, education and public administration.
Agriculture accounts for nine percent of employment in the East Kimberley and six
percent in the West. In absolute terms, 290 people work in agriculture in the East
Kimberley and 148 people employed in agriculture in Derby-West Kimberley, a
difference of 152. Much of this difference is historic. The most recent round of
investment in the Ord saw an increase of just 60 jobs despite investment of $364
million, or $6 million per job. In the decade to 2016 the unirrigated West Kimberley
saw agricultural employment increase by 22 jobs in the absence of large-scale
irrigation, much of this in high-value sub-industries.
Other opportunities exist for the West Kimberley. Aside from further investment in
major employers such as health and education, land management programs such as
the Indigenous rangers program have considerable promise. While comparison is
difficult, such programs can see a job being created for every $47,000 of public
investment, as opposed to the $6 million in government investment alone for each job
estimated in the Ord Scheme.
Tourism employment in the West Kimberley appears to trail the East Kimberley despite
similar offerings and proximity to an international airport in Broome. Establishment of
the Fitzroy River National Park and the in-development Great Kimberley Marine Park
could bring more opportunities. Carbon farming, renewable energy and high-value
niche agriculture are also avenues of potential development.
The comparison of East and West Kimberley demonstrates the need to look beyond
capital-intensive industries such as irrigated cropping and mining to develop northern
Australia. Investments in making northern Australian communities healthier, better
educated, better connected places to live in, stay in and move to are likely to be more
effective than risky investments in projects that generally benefit private investors and
a handful of employees.

Introduction
If pressed to pinpoint the factors that have most hampered European man’s
attempts to make a commercial success of agriculture in the North West, I
would unhesitatingly nominate distance, ignorance of the physical environment
and a reprehensible aversion to learning by experience (of others before you). 1
Dr FH Bauer – North Australia Research Unit, Australian National University, 1983

The north has untapped promise, abundant resources and talented people … A
strong north means a strong nation.2
Office for Northern Australia (2015), White Paper for Developing Northern Australia

Developing northern Australia has been a focus for Australian governments for over a
century. Government policy and money is directed at capital-intensive industries such
as large-scale irrigation or mining, ventures which often fail financially and always fail
to drive population growth and community development at the scales envisaged by
their promoters.
On some levels, little seems to have been learned. The focus of the federal
government’s Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and the Northern Australia
White Paper is firmly on the same-old approach. The WA Government’s Water for
Food program is dedicated to irrigation. However, some changes may be on the policy
horizon. The Fitzroy River Declaration by traditional owners outlines a different vision
for future development and this declaration was adopted by the Labor party during
their successful election campaign.3
As proposals to develop irrigated agriculture in the west Kimberley are being
considered, lessons from the east Kimberley need to be revised.
The Wyndham-East Kimberley and Derby-West Kimberley Local Government Areas
(LGAs) are similar in many respects. They are similar distances from Australia’s (and
Asia’s) main cities, with similar climates and landscapes. They both have similar areas

and total population. Derby-West Kimberley is approximately 118,000 square
kilometres and 7,728 people, while Wyndham-East Kimberley is 121,000 square
kilometres with 7,152 people. The labour force is larger in Wyndham-East Kimberley,
with 3,234 people employed compared to 2,319 in Derby-West Kimberley.4
A key difference between the two Kimberley LGAs is the Ord River Scheme in
Wyndham-East Kimberley. Since 1959, at least $2 billion has been spent on developing
large-scale irrigation in the Ord Scheme, of which over $1.5 billion has been public
money.5 Despite this investment, employment in the two LGAs is very similar.

East meets West
The employment profiles of Wyndham-East Kimberley and Derby-West Kimberley are
very similar. The major employers in each are health, education and public
administration, as shown in Figure 1 below:

Figure 1 shows that despite decades of effort, $2 billion in Ord Scheme investment,
along with over 14,000 hectares of irrigated farmland, and substantial amounts of
water used every year, agriculture is still only the fourth largest employer in
Wyndham-East Kimberley. 290 people work in agriculture in Wyndham-East Kimberley.
By contrast, there is very little irrigated agriculture in the Fitzroy River catchment, with
148 people employed in agriculture in Derby-West Kimberley, a difference of 152.
Figure 1 also shows considerable difference between the LGAs in Accommodation and
Food Services and Retail Trade, two key industries related to tourism, discussed further
below.
Considered as a percentage of the workforce in each area, the difference in
agricultural employment seems smaller still, as shown in Figure 2 below:

Figure 2 shows that while nine percent of employment in Wyndham-East Kimberley is
in agriculture, this figure is six percent in Derby-West Kimberley, a difference of just
three percent as Derby-West Kimberley has a smaller workforce. While large-scale
irrigation may dramatically change the landscape of an area, this difference of 3
percentage points demonstrates that irrigation has not dramatically transformed the
economy of the Kimberley.
Census data over the past decade also shows the minimal impact that later injections
of funding into the Ord scheme have had on the agricultural profile of the region. The
most recent round of investment in the scheme saw $364 million invested in the years
2010 to 2014.6 The change in overall agricultural employment in the two LGAs is

During the decade shown in Figure 3, total Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing
employment increased in Wyndham-East Kimberley by 59 jobs, or 26%. This represents
around $6 million in capital investment per job. The Western Australian Auditor
General similarly found that despite this public investment full time employment in the
Ord area increased by only 61 people plus 10 to 15 seasonal workers.7
However, Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing employment in neighbouring Derby-West
Kimberly also increased by 22 jobs or 17% over the same period without similar
investment in large-scale irrigation.
Some parts of agriculture are not associated with irrigation. Figure 4 below looks at
employment in sub-industries that are sometimes with irrigated agriculture,
specifically horticulture, cropping and forestry. It shows an increase of just 18 jobs in
Wyndham-East Kimberley, compared to 16 in Derby-West Kimberley (off a much
smaller base).

This is a story of two neighbouring LGAs – of which one has a multi-billion dollar dam
project. The Ord River scheme may have made changes to the physical landscape, but
it has not made major changes to the employment profile of Wyndham-East
Kimberley. On the contrary, its employment profile remains similar to that of its near
neighbour, where agricultural employment is not based on irrigation.

Other opportunities in the West
Kimberley
There are other opportunities to develop Northern Australia that do not have the
same risks and poor track record as irrigated agriculture projects. Perhaps most
obviously, the biggest employers in the Fitzroy region are education and healthcare.
Further investment in these established sectors will be likely to create more jobs and
have greater social and economic benefit than investing in risky, capital intensive
large-scale irrigated agriculture projects.
Other options including Indigenous ranger programs and tourism should be considered
when deciding how to spend taxpayers money developing Northern Australia.

Indigenous rangers
The Working on Country Program receives Federal Government funding to support
Indigenous ranger programs across Australia. In 2012-13 the program received $67
million in funding. In just 6 months from January to June 2012, 1,423 people were
employed through the program, although many of these are on a part-time or casual
basis.8 While comparison is difficult due to the nature of the work, this equates to
some form of employment being created for every $47,000 of public investment, as
opposed to the $6 million in government investment alone for each job estimate from
the Ord Scheme.
In the Fitzroy catchment the Nyikina Mangala people have developed their own
Walalakaloo Healthy Country Plan to plan for the future of their country. Part of this
plan is to develop the Indigenous rangers program in the area, with the aim of having
10 Nyikina Mangala rangers by 2018.9 With over 50 Aboriginal communities in the
catchment, there is strong potential for employment through Indigenous Ranger
Programs with relatively low public investment required.

Tourism
Hundreds of thousands of people visit the Kimberley region every year. In 2014
Tourism Western Australia estimated that 402,400 people visited the Kimberley.10 The
Department of Regional Development ranked tourism ahead of agriculture in value to
the region in its 2014 regional profile.11
The tourism industry could be boosted with the introduction of the promised Fitzroy
River National Park and the in-development Great Kimberley Marine Park.12
A report by Jack Carlsen of Tourism Research Services, commissioned by Environs
Kimberley and the Wilderness Society WA estimated that the establishment of a Great
Kimberley Marine Park could increase the tourism, cultural and conservation economy
of the Kimberley by almost 50% to $134 million per annum, supporting 367 jobs –
which represents an increase of almost two-thirds in employment.13
Cultural tourism is another growth area. Tourism WA recognises the Kimberley as
having the “highest density of quality Aboriginal tourism experiences in the State”,
with the potential to be Australia’s premier Indigenous tourism destination. 14 This
often overlaps with other tourism opportunities along the Fitzroy like camping, fishing
tours and the Indigenous art industry.15
The Walalakaloo Healthy Country Plan outlines tourism as a key business opportunity
that they could take advantage of with sufficient resourcing. The Plan ranked mining,
climate change, dams and water management among the highest threats to them
achieving their targets for their country.16

Other economic opportunities
The Kimberley region has been the subject of many proposals for economic
development that do not depend on large-scale irrigation.
Carbon farming: Traditional owners the Kimberley Land Council are participating in the
federal government’s Carbon Farming Initiative, by using Indigenous fire management
practices like savannah burning. These reduce the intensity and frequency of wild fires
by setting and managing “Right Way Fires”, which burn cooler with lower emissions.
Over two years, participating native title groups generated 230,000 Kyoto Australia
carbon credit units, and the land council has plans to expand to other native title
groups.17
Native “super fruit” harvesting and processing: The Kimberley is home to a light-green
fruit called gubinge (“Kakadu plum”), which is high in anti-oxidants and vitamin C. The
trees can go without water for long periods of time, and there are farming operations
involving hundreds of trees with crops worth tens or hundreds of thousands of
dollars.18 As well as being eaten as a health food, it sees use in cosmetics. In February
2018, a processing plant was built, allowing the manufacturing to occur on-site in the
Kimberley – instead of the value-adding taking place elsewhere.19
Renewable energy: The region has been the subject of considerable interest from the
renewable energy industry, including a proposal in November 2017 for onshore wind
and solar panels.20

Conclusion
Irrigation proposals in the Kimberley region have a long history of failure. To date no
project has proved itself to be economically viable without huge taxpayer subsidy. The
Camballin Irrigation Scheme failed altogether in the 1980s due to ongoing flooding,
pest problems, and a failure to prove economic viability to investors. The Ord River
Irrigation Scheme has had ongoing failures due to the realities of operating in a remote
area.
Even with the huge subsidies directed toward the Ord Scheme, the structure of
employment in the east Kimberley has not changed substantially from that of the west
Kimberley. This demonstrates the need to look beyond capital-intensive industries
such as irrigated cropping and mining to develop northern Australia. Investments in
making northern Australian communities healthier, better educated, better connected
places to live in, stay in and move to are likely to be more effective than risky
investments in projects that generally benefit private investors and a handful of
employees.

The Ord River irrigation scheme and

Attempts to develop northern Australia by
subsidising capital-intensive industries like irrigated
agriculture have a long and unimpressive history.
An example is the Ord River Scheme which currently
supports just 260 jobs despite $2 billion spent and
decades of effort. Different approaches are needed
if northern development is to be sustainable and
equitable in the 21st Century.

Summary
Australian governments have been trying to develop northern Australia for a long
time, with the latest policy papers and Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility just
the most recent in a long tradition of generally unsuccessful attempts to entice more
people to the continent’s north with the promise of jobs and prosperity.
The Ord River irrigation scheme in the east Kimberley region of WA, near to the NT
border, is one of the longest running, most expensive and best known attempts to
increase agricultural development in the north. With further Ord expansion proposed
under current northern development policies, this paper summarises the history of the
Ord and the economic assessments of its development:





Over $2 billion has been spent on developing irrigation agriculture in the Ord
region. Over $1.5 billion of this has been public money.
Between 1959 and 1991 the public accrued a financial loss of $939 million in
2016 dollars, representing a return of 17 cents for every public dollar invested.
Private investors made modest gains of $32 million during that period.
Since 2009 a further $364 million has been spent by taxpayers on expanding
areas of irrigation by 1,600 hectares, a subsidy of $227,500 per hectare. This
has created around 60 jobs, a cost of about $6 million per job.

Despite this investment,



Irrigated agriculture employs just 260 people in the region
The irrigated area of the Ord scheme represents just 1% of irrigated land in
Australia.

By contrast, the investment in social development through health, education and
community projects in the last Ord–East Kimberley Development package has been
delivered on-budget and well received by the community.
The history and economics of the Ord demonstrate a basic reality: public subsidy of
irrigated agriculture does not lead to large increases in employment or social
development. Irrigated agriculture in northern Australia is capital intensive, using
machinery and infrastructure rather than labour.
We need to work out what sort of development we want in northern Australia.
Investing in health, education and services that improve the lives of existing
communities would make these places more likely to keep and attract residents and

businesses. Agriculture should be a part of northern development, but investment
must be directed towards viable enterprises that pass a cost benefit analysis.
There is no shortage of industries, infrastructure and community projects that can help
develop northern Australia in a way that is economically viable, community-oriented
and sustainable. Long experience shows that expansion of the Ord River Irrigation Area
is not one of them.

Introduction
If we were spending the money ourselves and of our own choice, we would, I
think, like to have a good deal more information as to the problems of transport
and marketing. It is one thing to feel reasonably satisfied that certain
commodities can be grown under irrigation. It is, of course, quite another to
determine whether they can be profitably grown. Robert Menzies1
In retrospect, the most interesting aspect of the Ord River Irrigation Project is
that anyone should at any time have thought that it would be economically
viable. B. R. Davidson2
Australian governments have been trying to increase economic development in
northern Australia for over 100 years. The Abbott–Turnbull government is no
exception, going to the 2013 election with a specific northern Australia “vision”
document,3 publishing a white paper in June 2015,4 establishing the Northern Australia
Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) and assigning ministerial responsibility for northern
Australia.
Developing northern Australia means different things to different people. Few people
would oppose a goal of making the people of northern Australia healthier, happier and
more prosperous, or of aiming to ensure the land and resources of the north are used
productively and sustainably. All of these things could be achieved, but there are many
different policy approaches that could be taken. Some could lead to the kinds of
development that are widely supported, but others will not. As noted in the White
Paper, “many failed projects and plans litter the north”.5
With the renewed focus on developing northern Australia, it is time to learn from
some of those failures. From an economic perspective, few projects have failed as
spectacularly as the efforts to develop irrigation around the Ord River.

The Ord River is located in the north of Western Australia, in the east of the Kimberley
region, close to the border with the Northern Territory. It is around 320 kilometres in
length, running from the southeast of the Kimberley to the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf and
the Timor Sea, as shown in Figure 1 below:
Figure 1 – Ord region map

Conservation Geography

The Ord has two dams on it, a smaller ‘diversion dam’ near the town of Kununurra,
forming the Ord River reservoir, shown as a narrow pink line in Figure 1 above. The
larger Ord River Dam, or main dam, is further south and forms Lake Argyle, one of
Australia’s largest inland waterways.
The two dams provide water to the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA). The first stage of
ORIA resulted in 14,000 hectares of irrigated farmland being developed.6 This is around

17,000 soccer fields. For comparison, this represents 1 percent of the Murray Darling
Basin’s 1.4 million hectares of irrigated lands. Western Australia has a total of 50,000
hectares of irrigation area including the Ord, with larger areas between Perth, Bunbury
and Collie.7
The White Paper includes a proposal to expand the Ord Irrigation area by 14,500 ha:
Expanding the size of the Ord irrigation area offers the potential to achieve
scale and establish a variety of commercial crops in the district, which would
enhance both the profitability and economic resilience of the region.8
While the White Paper sounds optimistic about the profitability of establishing more
commercial crops on the Ord, determining if this is profitable is, as Robert Menzies
said, quite another thing. Even in Menzies’ day, dreams of developing the north and
the Ord in particular had often failed. Further Ord irrigation development also faces
Indigenous opposition and political uncertainty, with the Northern Territory
government focusing on other priorities.9

History of Ord River development
Pre-1950
The agricultural potential of the Ord River valley has excited European Australians
since they first explored it in the late 1870s. Efforts to develop tropical agriculture in
the north west soon followed, but by the late 1920s had ‘failed dismally’. 10
The first serious research into establishing irrigated agriculture began in the 1940s. The
first request for Commonwealth money came in 1949, when the WA government
requested a grant of 4.3 million pounds ($130 million dollars today) for agricultural
development. This initial Ord scheme was not funded, but the idea of developing
irrigation on the Ord had taken root.11

First dam
Through the 1950s, numerous proposals were made by Western Australian
governments for grants to develop its northern areas, including for irrigation schemes
around the Ord River. Some funding was received from the Commonwealth through
this time, which had a generally bipartisan position for developing the area on the
grounds of defence and closer settlement.12
It was not until 1959, however, that the Menzies federal government approved and
provided funding for the initial diversion dam on the Ord. Work began on the diversion
dam in 1961 and it was officially opened in 1963. Farms were then allocated for this
first phase of Ord irrigation between 1962 and 1965.13

Main dam and the Northern Myth
The main dam on the Ord was approved and federal grants provided two years later in
1967. This decision followed extensive public debate around the economic merit of the
main dam, perhaps most famously by economist Bruce Davidson in his book The
Northern Myth. Davidson was a persistent critic of government policy on developing

more intensive agriculture in the north of Australia, and of the Ord scheme in
particular, for decades.14
A key part of Davidson’s criticism was the early failures of the Ord region’s farms.
Extensive financial assistance had to be provided to cotton growers through the 1960s.
No review or assessment of the first part of the Ord development was conducted
before a decision was made to build and fund the main dam. When Federal
Governments expressed reluctance to keep funding a remote agricultural region
dependent on one crop, their hesitance was derided in Western Australia as ‘chronic
procrastination’.15
Despite federal reluctance and criticism from economists like Davidson, construction
of the main dam went ahead and was completed in 1972, creating Lake Argyle, one of
Australia’s largest reservoirs. Just two years later cotton crops were abandoned in the
ORIA altogether.

Chronic problems
Aside from cotton, beef and grain enterprises were also struggling financially in the
Ord. Pest problems, insecticide costs, transport and marketing costs all put ORIA at a
disadvantage to the rest of Australian agriculture. Despite, or perhaps because of, the
lack of financial viability of the whole scheme, the WA government borrowed millions
more from the Commonwealth to develop more irrigation holdings in 1974.16
By 1976 the complete economic failure of the scheme was obvious. WA Premier Sir
Charles Court, the WA Cabinet, technical advisors and top bureaucrats met and
concluded that the remoteness of the location could not be overcome by the existing
Ord scheme. Their solution was one that is echoed time and again in discussion of Ord
irrigation: it just needs to be bigger! More government money would be spent on
research, water subsidies, government guarantees, fixed prices, provision of transport,
handling and marketing infrastructure.17

Sugar rush
While numerous crops were experimented with, sugar became the great hope of the
Ord scheme in the late 1970s and to some extent remains so today. Sugar company

CSR began investigating the feasibility of operations in 1976, but it took until 1995 for
a sugar mill to be built in the region by CSR and the Ord River District Cooperative.18
The mill was sold in 2000 to a Korean corporation, Cheil Jedang, but was eventually
dismantled in 2008. No sugar was grown in 2007–08 in ORIA. Another great economic
hope for the scheme had failed completely.
Despite 30 years of failure, current Ord irrigation proponents are still calling for greater
areas of irrigation to grow sugar. Kimberley Agricultural Investments, the latest major
investor in Ord irrigation, says on its website that they “aim to establish a scale sugar
industry in the region,” and headlines like “Lack of scale crushing the Ord Irrigation
Scheme's sugar dream” still make regular appearances.19

Global Financial Crisis and beyond
Proposals to build ‘Ord Stage II’ grew through the late 1990s until they were eventually
funded by federal and state governments in 2009. The project formed part of the
Federal Government’s fiscal stimulus in response to the Global Financial Crisis.
Since the collapse of sugar the dominant product grown in the Ord has been
sandalwood, an aromatic tree that can be used to produce oil used in perfumes and
cosmetic goods as well as wood. Citrus, chickpeas, melons, pumpkin and mangoes are
also grown. Sandalwood accounts for the vast majority of the value of irrigated
production in the Ord region, although up-to-date data is scarce. 20

Ord Stage II and the Ord East
Kimberley Development Plan
While the expansion of ORIA had been suggested many times, the impetus for the
eventual expansion came in 2009 as the Australian Government responded to the
Global Financial Crisis with its $4.7 billion Economic Stimulus Package. Part of this
package was the Ord East Kimberley Development Plan, with a budget of $415 million,
which consisted of two parts:



The Ord Irrigation Expansion Project
The East Kimberley Development Package

In October 2016, the WA Auditor General released a review of the two parts of this
plan. In the following sections we look at the proposal and the result of the two parts
of the Development Plan.

Ord Irrigation Expansion Project
The Ord Irrigation Expansion Project part of the Ord–East Kimberley Development Plan
was budgeted at $220 million, to be paid by the Western Australian Government.
Launched in 2009, it was intended to facilitate:
The release of an initial 8,000 hectares of agricultural lots within the Weaber
Plains area in 2011. While this area of land is being prepared all the necessary
scoping work for another land package of up to 6,680 hectares comprising the
Packsaddle, Ord West Bank and Mantinea areas will be conducted. 21
The Weaber Plains/Goomig area was supposed to be subdivided into lots by the WA
Government’s Landcorp and sold to a range of agricultural businesses.
These plans were not fully realised. While 8,000 hectares of irrigated area were
planned, as of June 2016 only 1,600 were under crop, with the developers expecting

4,000 by late 2016. Only one developer has taken up a land allocation in the expanded
agricultural area, Chinese-owned Kimberley Agricultural Investment Pty Ltd. 22
Constructing the irrigation infrastructure took until December 2014 and cost the WA
Government $334 million, a cost overrun of $114 million, or 52 percent, according to
WA’s Auditor General.23
There was a complete lack of financial and economic planning around the
implementation of the irrigation project:
There was no specific business case or detailed costings undertaken for the
entire project prior to commencement of the project in 2009. There were [only]
costings for the first construction phase extending the main irrigation channel.
DRD did not prepare a comprehensive costing to support its request for $91
million in additional funding in 2011. The funding request explained that
construction costs were going to be much higher than originally anticipated, but
did not itemise where or what costs had increased. A revised budget was also
not prepared.24
Unsurprisingly, this delayed, costly, poorly planned irrigation development is not
providing socio-economic benefits:
Economic activity, employment and agricultural return were the main reasons
for Government support for the OEKD Plan. However, neither DRD nor DSD
currently have measures to monitor and report on these outcomes. In the
absence of these measures, DRD and DSD cannot show the impact of the
expansion project.25

East Kimberley Development Package
The other part of the Ord–East Kimberley Development Plan was the East Kimberley
Development Package. Administered by the Commonwealth, this $195 million dollar
program consisted of 27 separate projects:


Nine health projects, including an upgrade of Kununurra Hospital and
Wyndham health facilities and aged care and health facilities in remote areas.

Nine education projects, including early learning, primary, high school and TAFE
facilities
Two housing projects, social housing in Kununurra and Wyndham and
transitional housing in Kununurra and other locations.
Two transport projects – an upgrade to the Wyndham Port and Kununurra
Airport
Five community-oriented projects, relating mainly to sports and arts facilities.26

Unlike the irrigation infrastructure, the community projects were delivered on budget,
although with similar delays and lack of performance monitoring. Importantly, these
projects have delivered benefits for the local community:
Community response to the Commonwealth-funded social infrastructure
projects has generally been positive, although there is little reporting of
outcomes. For example, there are occupants in all 40 new transitional dwellings
in Kununurra, with a waitlist of around 30 people. Similarly, the number of
students enrolled at North Regional TAFE’s Kununurra campus increased
following the building program, from 865 students in 2013 to 1,064 students in
2015. However, the community impact of these projects has not been
measured.27
Budget overruns aside, the differences between the Ord irrigation expansion and the
community development package demonstrates a simple point. Investments in capitalintensive irrigation projects in remote regions are unlikely to create widespread
benefits for the community, while investing directly in community outcomes through
health and education is likely to be far more effective. The example of the Kununurra
TAFE campus demonstrates this. For a capital investment of $10 million, over 1,000
students benefit each year, with an expanded enrolment of 200 people. While direct
comparison is difficult, in the following sections we see that hundreds of millions of
dollars have been invested in irrigation infrastructure for just tens of jobs.

Ord River studies
Numerous economists and specialists from other disciplines have made assessments of
the Ord Schemes and related northern Australia development proposals. The most
prominent has been Bruce Davidson, author of the Northern Myth (discussed above).28
The most recent, publicly available cost benefit analysis was conducted by consultants
Hassall & Associates and covered the period between 1959 and 1991. The study was
commissioned by the WA Government’s now defunct Kimberley Water Resources
Development Office. 29 Hassall & Associates’ study was updated in a 2013 study by
Economists at Large commissioned by the Wilderness Society.30
In 2004 Marsden Jacob & Associates were commissioned by the Western Australian
Department of Industry and Resources to prepare a business case valuation for an
expansion of the Ord River Irrigation Area. This report was then updated in 2008. The
assessment found that the net cost to the public was likely to be between $63.5
million and $105.5 million.31
Despite finding a net cost of the expansion Marsden Jacobs recommended to the
Western Australian government that it should proceed due to concerns around the
scale of ORIA and expected downscaling of the nearby Argyle Diamond Mine.
Curiously, the report acknowledges that the local Aboriginal people have not derived
much advantage from the Argyle Diamond Mine, and so its closure would not
disadvantage them. But it goes on to say:

On the other hand, the failure to replace sugar growing and milling severely
reduces − and probably removes for several decades − the prospects of the
Miriuwung and Gajerrong people participating in the main stream economy. 32
Despite expecting a net financial cost to the public of between $63 million and $105
million, the business case recommended proceeding with the project on social
grounds, without ever considering whether this money could be better spent on
projects that would more directly benefit the Indigenous and non-Indigenous
community.
Other notable studies have looked at the Ord development from different
perspectives. This has included Lesley Head, who looked at the development from the
perspective of how we view development of the north, the role of the Aboriginal
people and the themes of colonialism.33
More recently, academic economists assessed the likely costs and benefits of
developing irrigation in northern Australia, finding that the costs of capital investment
would likely outweigh the benefits that would be capitalised into land values.34
The WA Auditor General also did additional work on the more recent investment of
public money, discussed above.

COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS
The Hassall & Associates cost benefit analysis is the most recent comprehensive cost
benefit analysis of ORIA. It was commissioned in the early 1990s as the Western
Australian Government was pushing to expand the ORIA. It prompted the Kimberley
Water Resources Development Advisory Board to investigate further possibilities for
expansion. The board appointed Hassall & Associates to look at the costs and benefits
of the ORIA to date and look for any potential for expansion.
Hassall & Associates produced a comprehensive cost – benefit analysis of ORIA from
1959 to 1991. Hassall & Associates found that by 1991 total public and private costs
were returning just 44 cents in the dollar. That is for every dollar invested in ORIA only

The cost benefit analysis shows total private and public costs of $1.6 billion against
total private and public benefits of $700 million. This means that over the 32 years
costs exceeded benefits by $900 million. Or, put another way, costs were more than
twice as large as benefits. While private benefits just exceeded private costs by $32
million, the public costs exceeded public benefits by almost $1 billion.
In order to best compare newer costs with older costs, the undiscounted figures from
Hassall & Associates were used. The more recent figures are also undiscounted. All
figures have been updated to 2016 dollars so they can be more easily compared.
Sensitivity analysis at various discount rates was done in the Hassall & Associates
report as well as the Economist at Large report. This analysis shows that the net
present value of the project was always a large negative value. Discounted figures
would change the numbers but not the fact that costs far exceed benefits.

Table 2 has only had limited private costs for the period from 1992 to 2014 as data on
private costs are not as readily available as public costs. Total costs in 2016 dollars now
exceed $2 billion.
Figures on benefits are also difficult to locate from 1992 onwards. The Hassall &
Associates cost benefit analysis showed that costs exceed benefits by more than 2 to 1,
and there is no indication that this has changed.
Before the government spends more taxpayer money on ORIA, a comprehensive cost
benefit analysis similar to the Hassall & Associates should be conducted. From the
available information it seems that the government and Australia are not getting value
for money.

35

Note: the figure of $364 million is in 2016 dollars. It is based on the WA Auditor General’s estimate of
$334 million in nominal dollars spent during the years 2009 to 2015, assuming the funds were spent
equally in each year, with each year’s spending converted to 2016 dollars and added. This approach
was taken to present consistent 2016 dollar figures throughout the report.

Employment and the Ord River
scheme
The 2011 census provides employment numbers by industry for local government
areas (LGA). The ORIA is located within the Wyndham–East Kimberley LGA. Wyndham–
East Kimberley LGA includes areas outside the ORIA so employment figures from the
census include areas outside the Ord River scheme, although these areas are sparsely
populated.
The top 10 employing industries in the in the Wyndham–East Kimberley LGA are
shown in Figure 2. Total employment for the area is 3,742, from a population of 7,800.

Figure 2 shows that employment in the area is highest in the health care sector, with
construction, public administration and mining also important employers. Despite the
enormous investment in irrigation infrastructure, agriculture is only the sixth largest
employer in the LGA, highlighted in red (although, as they date from 2011,
employment numbers in Figure 2 do not include people employed by the most recent
expansion of ORIA).
This is not unusual. Most parts of Australia, including regional areas, have health care,
construction, education and other services as major employers. Agricultural and

mining employment in this region are proportionately higher than Australian or
probably state averages. However, this serves to emphasise that agricultural
development is not labour intensive.
The inability of irrigation investment to create employment is further emphasised
when the agriculture sector is examined in more detail. Figure 3 below shows
agricultural employment by sub-industry in the Wyndham–East Kimberley LGA:

Employment in the agricultural industry in this region is dominated by forestry and
beef cattle farming. Forestry employment is reliant on irrigation and is mainly focused
on Indian Sandalwood plantations. Sandalwood generates less employment than many
crops because for most of a tree’s multi-year life it requires little labour.
Employment in the beef industry is not closely related to irrigation infrastructure. Beef
grazing in the Wyndham–East Kimberley LGA is mainly extensive grazing on large
properties that are unlikely to benefit directly from ORIA. While cattle grazing is a
considerable part of agriculture in the LGA, this activity would occur even in the
absence of the ORIA.
This is highlighted by looking at employment in the similar nearby LGA of Halls Creek.
This LGA has similar physical features to Wyndham–East Kimberly but has not had the
substantial investment in irrigation that has occurred in ORIA. In Halls Creek total
employment in Agriculture is 80 persons, of which 73 are in cattle grazing. This shows
that cattle grazing would be a significant part of the region even without investment in
irrigation schemes.

Figure 3 includes employment in catch-all categories such as Agriculture nfd (not
further defined), Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing nfd and Other Agriculture and
Fishing Support Services. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) uses these
categories for employment that does not neatly fit into the larger sub-industries.
Employment in these categories may or may not be related to irrigated agriculture.
Assuming that all non-cattle employment is related to ORIA, total employment related
to the scheme is around 200 according to the 2011 census. More recently, the WA
Auditor General reported that employment relating to the recent expansion was 61
people plus 10–15 seasonal workers.36
Given the public investment of $334 million ($364 million in 2016 dollars), 61 jobs is
not a large increase in employment from the latest expansion. Similarly, across the
whole scheme, employment of around 270 people is small when compared to the $2
billion in public and private costs including more than $1.5 billion of public money, in
2016 dollars. This simple exercise confirms the results of the more complete analyses
done that show only a small benefit when compared to the substantial costs.

Conclusion
With renewed political emphasis on developing northern Australia, it is important to
consider exactly what sort of development we want in the North. The Ord irrigation
scheme demonstrates that more than space, money and water is required to build
communities and generate employment. Billions of dollars have been spent on
irrigation projects that have led to huge losses for taxpayers and only a small number
of jobs in the East Kimberley.
Even if these projects had been better managed and more financially successful, the
result in terms of employment and community development would be similar.
Irrigated agriculture in locations like northern Australia is land and capital intensive.
The industry uses huge areas of land and lots of machinery, but does not employ lots
of people.
There is scope for further development of agriculture in northern Australia, but efforts
should be directed towards enterprises that are commercially viable, sustainable and
generate employment and other benefits for northern Australian communities. This is
demonstrated by the finding that of the 260 people employed in agriculture in the
Wyndham East Kimberley local government area at the 2011 census, at least 60
worked in agricultural enterprises with little direct relationship with irrigation. Many
non-irrigated agricultural enterprises in northern Australia are commercially viable and
generate net benefits for local and wider communities.
Irrigation enterprises working with existing infrastructure may also be viable and worth
supporting now that the infrastructure is already built – in economics jargon, the costs
are ‘sunk’. The key message to come out of decades of losses on Ord infrastructure is
that new irrigation infrastructure in northern Australia is unlikely to be viable or
provide significant community benefits. The money can be far better spent.
The East Kimberley Development Package shows that investment directly in services
and infrastructure that benefit communities can be delivered on budget and generate
benefits for residents. If these communities are to retain existing populations and
attract new people and businesses then improving the lives of the people living there
will be important. Health, education and transport infrastructure are likely to provide
community benefit more effectively than investment in capital intensive industries like
new irrigated agriculture. Other investments such as communication infrastructure –
mobile phone reception, access to internet, high-speed broadband – are also likely to
generate direct benefits for communities.

One industry that is labour intensive and has strong potential in northern Western
Australia is the tourism industry. According to Tourism Western Australia, in the year
ending September 2016 there were 1.4 million visitors to the North West of WA, who
spent $1.2 billion.37 Tourism and transport infrastructure will play a major role in
developing the north.
Investing in the Indigenous community should also be a focus for northern
development. There are enormous social and economic benefits from programs such
as the Indigenous Protected Area and Indigenous Rangers schemes, which provide
training and employment for indigenous people in environmental management.38 Cost
benefit analyses of indigenous social programs consistently show that they provide
large net economic benefits.39
In short, there is no shortage of industries, infrastructure and community projects that
can help develop northern Australia in a way that is economically viable, communityoriented and sustainable. Long experience with the Ord River Irrigation Area shows
that government spending on irrigated agriculture is financially dubious and not likely
to lead to the sort of development that would benefit the communities of northern
Australia.

Summary
The Community Development Program (CDP) is remote Australia’s Work for the Dole
(WFD) and “job assistance” scheme. In place since 2015, it operates across almost 75
percent of Australia’s area, an area with a population of just 304,000 people.
Indigenous people are over 80% of the CDP’s 34,000 participants. In other words, CDP
participants are 11 percent of the population in these regions.
This highlights a key point about remote Australia – there just are not jobs to be had.
CDP regions have unemployment rates of up to 51%, when averaged across states and
can be higher still at a local level. The situation is not helped by low educational
attainment and low household incomes. A median family income in the NT’s CDP
regions is just $1,137 per week, compared to the Australian average of $1,734.
The CDP has been criticised by civil society groups, Indigenous groups, academics and
even police with allegations that it pays below minimum wage and its penalty system
is punitive, entrenching poverty, causing housing stress and even hunger. The Arnhem
Land Progress Aboriginal Association has reported that fresh food sales at its stores
declined by almost 10% per year under the two years of the CDP’s operation. 1
CDP participants are typically required to work 25 hours a week for $280 a week, or
$11.20 per hour. The current minimum wage is $18.29 per hour. That is before any
penalties that might be incurred.
In the most recent quarter, CDP participants received 52,813 penalties. A CDP
participant is more than 25 times more likely to receive a penalty than a participant in
urban Australia’s Jobactive program. They are 55 times more likely to receive a serious
penalty, as shown in Figure 1:

Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion has defended the CDP, saying “the number of
payments that have been breached [as a result of penalties] represent less than 1% of
the total welfare payments made to people not in work in remote communities”.
This 1% figure is misleading. Firstly, it appears to compare CDP penalties to total
welfare payments. Current volumes of penalties suggest they cost $18.4 million per
year, or $542 per year per CDP participant (3.7% of their total income support).
However, some CDP participants have stricter Work for the Dole requirements, and
these 18,000 people are far more likely to be penalised. The total cost of penalties
could represent 7.0% of their income support.
In practice, penalties do not apply equally to participants. For the 1,641 CPD
participants last quarter who receive a serious penalty with a part waiver, the loss of
an average of $746 represents 20.5% of their income support. For the 441 CDP
participants last quarter who receive a serious penalty with no waiver, the loss of
$2,314 represents 63.6% of their income support.
The Minister also claims that the CDP has:




supported job seekers into more than 15,000 jobs.
achieved more than 5,000 26 week employment outcomes.
placed more than 85 per cent of eligible job seekers in work-like activities

A different interpretation of CDP’s results is that:

4

Remote control

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 105





Each year, less than one in five CDP participants is supported into a job, and
less than one in 10 remains in that job for six months.
On average, a CDP participant would spend 9.5 years in the scheme before
achieving a 13-week employment outcome.
On average, a participant would spend 12.7 years in the scheme before
achieving a 26-week employment outcome.

The CDP is also expensive. For every dollar that a CDP recipient receives in income
support, approximately 70 cents is spent administering the scheme. It costs five times
as much per participant as Jobactive and twice as much as the scheme it replaced.
The achievement of 2,682 part- and full-time 26-week employment outcomes each
year must be put in the context of the overall CDP scheme, which costs about $360
million per year to operate. That amount could directly employ 19,700 people for 26
weeks full-time.
The task the CDP is expected to perform is herculean. Remote Australia has few jobs
and a disadvantaged workforce. However, the CDP is failing. It pays less than minimum
wage and imposes harsh penalties that can cost already low income households
dearly. It costs taxpayers far more than similar programs. The government’s claims
about the success of the program are based on creative interpretation of statistics, not
on outcomes. The CDP needs urgent reform or replacement.

Introduction
The Community Development Program (CDP) is the main program of job-related
assistance for unemployed people in remote areas of Australia. It is effectively Work
for the Dole (WFD) for vast areas of the country, and being focused on remote areas
Indigenous Australians are the vast majority – around 84% – of its 33,000–38,000
participants (participant numbers fluctuate).
The CDP began in 2015 as the Coalition Government’s replacement for the Remote
Jobs and Communities Program, which itself replaced the Community Development
and Employment Program (CDEP). The CDP has been criticised by various civil society
groups, Indigenous groups, academics and even police with allegations that the
program has implemented punitive penalties to participants resulting in entrenched
poverty, housing stress and even hunger.2
Tony Abbott has since said:
Abolishing CDEP was a well-intentioned mistake and CDP is our attempt to
atone for it.3
By contrast, Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion has defended the CDP, claiming
it “has been a success” although conceding “more needs to be done”. The government
points to various statistics to demonstrate this success, for example:




The CDP has supported job seekers into more than 15,000 jobs.
Participants have achieved more than 5,000 26-week employment
outcomes.
85 per cent of eligible job seekers have been placed in work-like activities.4

Putting the CDP in context
The CDP operates across nearly 6 million square kilometres, including the most remote
regions of the country, with larger towns generally excluded from the program. The
program is divided into 60 regions across Western Australia, Northern Territory, South
Australia, Queensland and NSW, as shown in Figure 1 below:

Table 1 shows that just over 300,000 people live in CDP areas. 11 percent of the total
population in CDP areas are participants in the CDP, with up to 18 percent in the NT.
The 2016 census gives us data on the size of the labour force (the number of people
who are employed or are actively looking for a job) in the CDP regions. If we assume
that those who are participating in the CDP program make up all the unemployed,
then the unemployment rate in state CDP regions varies between 17 percent and 51
percent.
By contrast Jobactive, the program in urban and regional areas, has around 760,000
participants, just 3 percent of the total population. Clearly, labour markets in remote
Australia are very different to those in more populated areas. There simply are not
jobs for people to find.

INDIGENOUS POPULATION
The population of CDP regions has a high proportion of Indigenous Australians. As
shown in Table 2, while CDP regions contain just one percent of the total Australian
population, 15 percent of Australia’s Indigenous population live in these areas.

at around 80%,5 suggesting that Indigenous people have greater difficulty in accessing
employment in CDP regions.

EDUCATION, AGE AND INCOME
CDP areas have fewer people who have completed high school, younger median age

Table 3 shows that population in all CDP areas has substantially lower levels of high
school completion, with no state’s regions having over 50%. Populations are generally
younger than the Australian median and household income is 18% lower.
The state with the highest median income in CDP areas is Western Australia, with
$1,745 per week (higher than the Australian average). This is because the CDP areas
incorporating WA’s iron ore mining centre in the Pilbara. If the Pilbara region is
excluded then the median family income falls to $1,341. In addition, Indigenous
families tend to be larger than the Australian average, meaning that incomes per
person are likely to be lower still.
Given that the CDP operates across regions with few job prospects, high Indigenous
populations, low education, and income levels, we might expect the program to take
these issues into account and make participation easier and more flexible. This has not
been the case. The CDP is far stricter than the programs it replaced or the Jobactive
program that most Australians in populated areas would access.

PARTICIPATION
Where possible, we have used a standard rate of CDP participants of 34,000.
Participation in the scheme has been falling since it began, which means that estimates
of penalties per participant and likelihood of job placements are actually conservative.
In addition, participants enter and leave the scheme over time, so while there may be
34,000 participants at any one point in a year, more than 34,000 participants would
have been covered by the scheme overall in the year.
Participation figures in the CDP and the RJCP are available since January 2014, when
there were 36,416 participants. By July 2017, the number had fallen to 32,670 – a
reduction of 10%.

HISTORY AND BACKGROUND OF THE CDP
In remote areas, job related assistance like Work for the Dole should be structured
differently to account for the lack of paid work opportunities, the unique challenges of
remote life and – for most participants – Indigenous cultural and social practices.
CDP was specifically structured to be closer to full-time work than previous remote
programs or indeed the concurrent Jobactive program (which covers 20 times as many
people). The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet says that remote areas don’t
have established labour markets, but used that lack to argue for a much stricter regime
than applies anywhere else in the country:
In its advice to Government, PM&C proposed that Work for the Dole
participation requirements should vary from the mainstream income support
payment participation requirements. PM&C noted that implementing Work for
the Dole for only six months of each year would not work in remote
communities which often had virtually non-existent labour markets and where

12

Remote control

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 105

there was a need to establish social norms. Consequently, PM&C advised that
‘only a comprehensive full time Work for the Dole program applied to all
jobseekers will work in remote regions’. ‘Continuous’ Work for the Dole
activities was also considered a key factor in reducing the high level of idleness
in communities’.6
Previous remote programs also accounted for the nature of work in remote areas, but
by providing more flexibility and variety rather than trying to emulate full-time work in
places without conventional labour markets. In some cases, the schemes were much
more ambitious in scope.
When Dr HC (Nugget) Coombs championed the establishment of the CDEP in 1977, he
outlined a broad scope for the program:
[It is] not simply a means of providing employment as a source of a minimum
cash income, but a training exercise in self-management and increasing
independence for the Aboriginal communities involved.7
For the thirty years of its operation, CDEP fulfilled that role, with academic Jon Altman
outlining five main roles for CDEP.
1. it provides flexible employment opportunities, often in contexts where there
are no, or limited, mainstream employment opportunities, particularly for
Indigenous people.
2. it provides income security and the opportunity to earn additional income from
employment and enterprise [in particular, the scheme did not have the
standard social security taper so participants could earn more without the loss
of base income].
3. it provides opportunity for education and training.
4. it can assist participants to move into mainstream (unsubsidised) employment.
5. and most innovatively, it acts as an instrument for economic and community
development.8

Scheme structures
Under both CDP and Jobactive, “jobseekers” (those with participation requirements
attached to their income support) are required to Work for the Dole. However, the
CDP scheme has considerably higher work requirements which, combined with
bureaucratic penalty enforcement, results in many more penalties being applied to
CDP participants than Jobactive participants. These penalties are financial, amounting
to about 20% of a weekly dole payment ($56 for someone on $280 a week, for
example) per ‘no show’ breach.9

WORK REQUIREMENTS
About 33,000-35,000 people are covered by CDP.10 Of these, about 18,000 are Work
for the Dole participants and 16,000 are Basic Services-only participants.11 Basic
Services are the job assistance provided to all participants. Basic Services-only
participants are those not required to Work for the Dole.12
CDP Work for the Dole participants are typically required to work 25 hours a week for
46 weeks a year (1,150 hours a year), and that work must take place on all five week
days (Monday to Friday).13 Jobactive Work for the Dole participants are typically
required to work 15 hours a week for 26 weeks a year (390 hours a year), and work
does not have to take place on all five week days. Jobactive participants under 30 years
of age are required to work 25 hours a week, although again only for 26 weeks rather

$280 is used as a benchmark in this report as it is the weekly Newstart payment for a single person

than 46 (650 hours a year).14 Note that from September 2018 Jobactive participants
under 50 will be required to work 25 hours a week.15
Jobactive participants receive weekly income support for Work for the Dole roughly
equivalent to what they would make if they were earning minimum wage for those
hours. For example, a participant receiving $280 a week and working 15 hours is
effectively “earning” $18.67 per hour for those weeks where they are required to work
(the current minimum wage is $18.29 per hour).16 Those expected to work for 25
hours, like CDP participants, instead effectively “earn” $11.20 an hour, and that is
before financial penalties are considered.
This contrasts most strikingly with the CDEP, where participants “earned” their income
support through 15 hours of work, and then additional “top up” pay at award rates
was often available if participants worked more hours. On average, CDEP participants
earned $100 more per week than those on income support outside of the scheme. 17
When Jobactive participants receive a serious penalty resulting in a freezing of income
support, they can “work off” their penalty by temporarily working 25 hours a week. In
other words, the standard workload for CDP participants is considered a punishment
for most Jobactive participants.

PENALTY STRUCTURE
The most common penalty for CDP participants is a No Show No Pay penalty, which
results in a loss of 10% of their fortnightly income support, or about $56.
After three No Show No Pay penalties in a six month period, participants are
considered for a serious penalty: a suspension of income support for up to eight
weeks. The eight week penalty can be partially or wholly waived, or participants can
“work it off”.
A peculiar outcome of the extra work requirements for CDP participants is that to
“work off” your eight week penalty you can Work for the Dole for 25 hours a week.
That’s a significant penalty for those on Jobactive, who usually only work 15 hours a
week, but not a penalty for CDP participants who are already required to work 25
hours a week.18

CDP providers have a financial incentive to log non-attendance by participants (which
leads automatically to a financial penalty applied by Centrelink).19 Providers are
randomly checked to ensure they are applying the rules.
Under CDEP, providers had flexibility in terms of what qualified as “work” and how to
manage staff absences.20 In CDP, there is little room for discretion, with one provider
saying:
If we penalise someone under this model it impacts their housing, their ability
to pay their power – so there is really no safety net.21
The strictness of the penalty structure, and its administration by Centrelink far from
the coalface, leads to inflexibility despite the realities of life in remote Australia. These
include high demand for the few community phones available and language barriers
when calls do get through to Centrelink.22 The National Audit Office found lengthy wait
times for Centrelink calls, and that these times had worsened over the last few years,
although remote areas did have shorter wait times on average.23

COMPARING PENALTIES
Compared to Jobactive, CDP has far fewer participants, but far higher portions of
penalties, particularly serious penalties. More penalties are handed out to CDP
participants than to Jobactive participants, even though there are 20 times more
Jobactive participants than CDP participants.
In the quarter ending June 2017, CDP participants received 52,813 penalties, including
44,451 No Show No Pay penalties. In the same period, Jobactive participants received
44,593 penalties.24 This means that a CDP participant was more than 25 times more
likely to receive a penalty than a Jobactive participant.

In the quarter ending June 2017, CDP participants received 7,868 serious penalties,
which result in up to eight weeks without income support. Fewer serious penalties
were applied to Jobactive participants, 3,215, meaning that CDP participants were 55
times more likely to receive a serious penalty than a Jobactive participant.25
Figure 3 illustrates the two ways in which CDP participants are disproportionately
penalised. Per person, they receive many more penalties than Jobactive participants
do. The share of serious penalties is even more skewed against CDP participants.

The CDP’s predecessor, the RCJP, also had more penalties per participant than the
mainstream income support. However, the distortion was much less extreme. Figure 4
demonstrates the significant growth in penalties between the final quarter of the RJCP
(June 2015) and the most recent quarter of the CDP (June 2017). Five times as many
penalties and six times as many serious penalties are applied under the CDP as were
applied under the analogous RJCP scheme two years earlier.

In its final quarter, RJCP participants received 10,842 penalties.26 That is about onefifth as many penalties as were applied in the most recent quarter of the CDP scheme,
and it was the quarter with the highest number of penalties over the lifetime of the
scheme. Even then, RJCP participants were “only” seven times more likely to receive a
penalty than a non-remote jobs assistance participant,27 rather than the 25 times more
likely they were in the most recent quarter of the CDP.

SEVERITY OF PENALTIES
The CDP penalty regime is costing people in remote areas a significant share of their
overall income support.
Last year, in response to concerns about excessive penalties, Minister Scullion stated
that “the number of payments that have been breached [as a result of penalties]

represent less than 1% of the total welfare payments made to people not in work in
remote communities”.28
However, penalties now represent a much larger portion of the welfare payments of
some people in remote areas. CDP participants who receive a serious penalty are at
risk of losing up to 64% of their welfare payments in a quarter. In addition, the number
of penalties has increased dramatically. The most recent quarter saw 44% more
penalties, and 64% more serious penalties, than when Minister Scullion made his
remarks.
Since we know that a “penalty day” is worth 10% of a fortnight’s income support, or
about $56, we can calculate a rough figure for how much income support is lost
annually from penalties. Those on higher or lower levels of income support would
receive proportionally higher or lower penalties, but the portion of their overall
income that the penalty represents would stay the same.

Penalties greater for some participants
Some people are disproportionately penalised under the CDP, meaning that the effect
of penalties on their welfare payments is far greater than the overall numbers would
suggest.
CDP participants receive 1,641 partially waived and 441 not-waived eight week
penalties per quarter. That represents a loss of $2.1 million per quarter from serious
penalties. They also received 44,945 short term “penalty days” in the last quarter,
which represents a further $2.5m lost each quarter.
For the 1,641 CPD participants a quarter who receive a serious penalty with a part
waiver, the loss of an average of $746 represents 20.5% of their income support that
quarter.
For the 441 CDP participants each quarter who receive a serious penalty with no
waiver, the loss of $2,314 represents 63.6% of their income support that quarter.
Between them, these two groups represent 6% of all CDP participants.
This is calculated from the Department of Employment release of 2015-16 data for
what share of serious penalties are partially or fully waived, and the number of weeks

of income support lost. 94% of serious penalties under the CDP were waived,29
although this includes penalties that are “worked off”.30 Four-fifths of these (78%)
were fully waived and the remaining fifth (22%) were partially waived (on average,
those receiving a partial waiver missed 2.4 weeks of income support).31 See Table 5
below for more details.
The overall burden of penalties is likely to be concentrated on the 18,000 CDP
participants who have Work for the Dole participants. Almost half of CDP participants,
about 16,000, are on “Basic Services”. While it is possible for them to receive
penalties,32 it is likely that a disproportionate number of penalties are applied to those
with daily Work for the Dole requirements.
If all penalties are accrued by the 18,000 participants with Work for the Dole
requirements, this represents 7.0% of their income support.

Penalties growing over time
Even if penalties are distributed across all CDP participants, and not limited to those
with Work for the Dole requirements, they still represent 3.7% of the income support
paid to CDP participants.
The dramatic increase in the number of CDP penalties means that Minister Scullion’s
figure of 1% is now out-of-date. In addition, Minister Scullion is comparing penalties,
which only apply to some people not in work, with welfare payments to all people not
in work in remote communities.
The June 2017 quarter had 44% more penalties for CDP recipients, including 64% more
serious penalties, than the average for the 2015-16 year.

If current volumes of penalties continue, the penalty regime will cost welfare
recipients about $4.6 million a quarter, or $18.4 million per year. This is $135 a quarter
($542 a year) for each of the 34,000 CDP participants, or 3.7% of their total income
support.

Calculations
Table 5 demonstrates the overall impact of penalties on CDP participants per quarter.
Short-term penalties each represent a single “penalty day”, that is to say a 10%
reduction in a person’s fortnightly welfare payments. Serious penalties are broken
down by those receiving a full waiver (no penalty), no waiver (eight weeks lost, i.e. 40
penalty days) or partial waiver (resulting in an average of 2.4 weeks lost, i.e. 12 penalty
days).
This gives a total of 82,267 penalty days per quarter, for a total income support loss of
$4.6m a quarter.
Table 6 then applies these figures to all CDP participants, the average CDP participant,
and then two example CDP participants: one who receives a part waiver (after 2.4
weeks, the average) and one who receives no waver.
For these people, the total loss is far greater than the average of 3.7%. For those
receiving no waiver, it is as high as 64%. This is actually a conservative estimate, since
people receiving serious penalties would also receive more short-term penalties, but in
this analysis they have just been assigned the average, of $74/quarter.
Table 7 converts the quarterly results from Table 5 and Table 6 to yearly ones.

COST OF DELIVERY
The CDP costs five times as much per participant to deliver as the scheme operating
elsewhere in the country, Jobactive. Remote schemes are to be expected to be more
expensive to deliver, but significantly the CDP also costs twice as much to deliver per
participant as the RJCP did.33 The RJCP is the scheme that the CDP replaced, so it also
had to contend with the difficulties of remote delivery.
Significantly, this cost is separate and additional to the cost of income support
payments to CDP recipients.
Figure 5 shows the costs of delivering the CDP and comparable programs to
participants. For reference, it also shows the annual income support that a Newstart
recipient would expect to receive (single, no children). For every dollar that a CDP
recipient receives in income support, approximately an additional 70 cents is spent
administering the CDP scheme.
It should be noted that there are a variety of levels of income support, some higher
and some lower than $14,560 per annum. The CDP scheme also has participants who

JOB PLACEMENTS AND OUTCOMES
Fewer than one in five CDP participants, 6,670 people, are placed in work each year,
and less than half of them remain in that placement for six months or more.
Minister Scullion announced in May that CDP had placed over 15,000 participants in
jobs, with 5,000 of those having achieved a six-month employment outcome, since it
began in July 2015.34 The National Audit Office has somewhat lower but similar figures
(12,226 placements, 6,544 13-week employment outcomes and 4,915 26-week
employment outcomes).35 These figures are for just under two years. Per year, this
represents 6,670 placements, 3,570 13-week outcomes and 2,682 26-week outcomes.
Of the 13- and 26-week placements, about a third are “partial” employment outcomes
and the remainder are “full” employment outcomes.36 A full outcome is where a
participant fully meets their Mutual Obligation Requirements, typically because they

are employed for 25 hours a week or earn enough to receive no income support. It
does not mean that they are employed full time.
With 34,000 CDP participants,37 in a given year each participant has a 19.6% chance to
receive a job placement. 54% of those placed will remain employed for 13 weeks, and
40% of those placed will remain employed for 26 weeks.38 46% will not make it to a 13week outcome.
Put another way, a CDP participant would spend an average of 9.5 years in the scheme
before achieving a 13-week employment outcome. During that time, $99,933 would
have been spent delivering CDP services to that person. Assuming the person is
employed full time at minimum wage,39 they would earn $9,040 over their 13-week
employment.
A participant would spend 12.7 years on average in the scheme before achieving a 26week employment outcome. The CDP delivery cost at that time would be $133,055,
and the participant would be expected to earn about $18,080 during their six months
of employment. Of course, some would continue in their employment and leave the
CDP scheme after that time, saving future CDP delivery costs.
In its first year, the RJCP achieved a similar number of job placements, 6,508. It had
many fewer 13-week and 26-week employment outcomes (1,167 and 387),40 but since
it was the scheme’s first year, many placements would not have run for 13 or 26 weeks
by the end of the year.
Analogous data was not reported in 2014-15, RJCP’s second and final year. However,
the broader Jobs, Land and Economy Programme (of which RJCP would represent
about a third of job placements) saw 44% of job placements achieve a 26-week job
outcome in that year.41 This is similar to the CDP’s rate of 40%. RJCP also cost half as
much per participant to deliver.

37

This is actually a conservative figure. While there are about 34,000 participants at a time, the
“jobseeker caseload” per year is 38,000, reflecting people entering and leaving the scheme. ANAO

The achievement of 2,682 part- and full-time 26-week employment outcomes each
year must be put in the context of the overall CDP scheme, which costs about $360
million per year to operate. That amount could directly employ 19,700 people for 26
weeks full-time,42 or it could employ 30,300 people for 26 weeks for 25 hours a week
(a “full employment outcome” as defined in the CDP). This is separate to the cost of
income support payments themselves.
Minister Scullion has described “getting people into jobs” as “the best part” of the CDP
scheme.43 In each year, less than 10% of CDP participants receive a job that lasts six
months or more.

Conclusion
CDP participants live in remote areas with high unemployment and low incomes. These
are places that generally lack conventional job markets. Despite the limitations of
remote life, the CDP scheme has stricter requirements and harsher penalties than both
the schemes that it replaced and the schemes operating elsewhere in Australia.
There are 20 times as many non-remote welfare recipients as there are CDP
participants, but CDP participants receive more penalties. A penalty can cost up to
eight weeks in income support in a quarter, or 64% of the participant’s income.
Minister Scullion is correct that the participants in the CDP have been placed into
15,000 jobs. However, almost half do not remain in these jobs for 13 weeks, and more
than half do not remain in them for 26 weeks. Overall, less than one in 10 CDP
participants each year is placed in a job that they remain in for six months or more.
The harshness of the scheme has not achieved results. It is twice as expensive to
administer as the schemes that it replaced, and a participant can expect to spend over
12 years on average in the scheme before achieving six months of employment. That
employment may not even be full time.

is funded by donations from philanthropic trusts and individuals and commissioned
research. Since its launch in 1994, the Institute has carried out highly influential
research on a broad range of economic, social and environmental issues.

OUR PHILOSOPHY
As we begin the 21st century, new dilemmas confront our society and our planet.
Unprecedented levels of consumption co-exist with extreme poverty. Through new
technology we are more connected than we have ever been, yet civic engagement is
declining. Environmental neglect continues despite heightened ecological awareness.
A better balance is urgently needed.
The Australia Institute’s directors, staff and supporters represent a broad range of
views and priorities. What unites us is a belief that through a combination of research
and creativity we can promote new solutions and ways of thinking.

OUR PURPOSE – ‘RESEARCH THAT MATTERS’
The Institute aims to foster informed debate about our culture, our economy and our
environment and bring greater accountability to the democratic process. Our goal is to
gather, interpret and communicate evidence in order to both diagnose the problems
we face and propose new solutions to tackle them.
The Institute is wholly independent and not affiliated with any other organisation. As
an Approved Research Institute, donations to its Research Fund are tax deductible for
the donor. Anyone wishing to donate can do so via the website at

Summary
Developing northern Australia is a priority for the Turnbull Government, like many
governments before it. The focus of these efforts is often on capital-intensive major
projects such as irrigation dams or mining infrastructure. Such investments generally
provide terrible returns to the taxpayer, generate few jobs and fail to ‘develop the
North’. For example, the Ord River irrigation scheme has returned just 17 cents for
every dollar and while recent expansion did increase employment, it was at a cost of
$6 million per job.
By contrast, investment into social and environmental programs that focus on
Indigenous communities can provide large economic benefit, as well as social and
environmental improvements. This paper reviews four economic assessments of such
programs:








A cost benefit analysis of the Yuendumu Mediation and Justice Committee by
University of Canberra economists estimated net benefits of $14.1 million at a
benefit cost ratio of 4.3:1. Major benefits included reduced prison, policing and
justice centre costs, as well as increased productivity in the community.
Assessment of the Mornington Island Restorative Justice Project by research
agency Colmar Brunton commissioned by the Department of Prime Minster
and Cabinet found the project had helped restore order in the community and
increased community safety and trust. The assessment did not quantify
benefits such as reduced crime rates and policing costs but found that they
were ‘significant’.
Analysis of five Indigenous Protected Area and Work on Country programs by
Social Ventures Australia, commissioned by Department of Prime Minster and
Cabinet found these programs delivered returns on investment of between
1.5:1 and 3.4:1. Key benefits include better environmental management,
increased skills and confidence in indigenous workers and increased economic
opportunities in the protected areas.
A cost benefit analysis of Healing Centres by Deloitte Access Economics
estimated average benefit cost ratio of 4.4:1 for indigenous healing centres.
These centres focus on reducing intergenerational trauma and disadvantage in
communities and creating physically, socially and culturally safe spaces led by
and for Indigenous people.

These economic assessments show that investing more in Indigenous communities
should be a priority for governments wanting to ‘develop the North’.

Introduction
The development of northern Australia has been a long-standing issue for Australian
governments and the Turnbull government is no different, establishing the ministerial
role of Minister for Resources and Northern Australia in 2015 and unveiling a host of
new initiatives within the framework of ‘Our North, Our Future’ — the first White
Paper on developing northern Australia.1 These initiatives include the Northern
Australia Infrastructure Facility (that provides concessional loans for infrastructure
projects across the north), the Northern Australia Roads Programme and the National
Water Infrastructure Development Fund, to name just a few.2
Most attempts to ‘develop the North’ emphasise large-scale capital-intensive projects,
often focused on irrigated agriculture, mining or gas projects. For example, the Ord
River irrigation scheme in the east Kimberly region of Western Australia has been
supported by governments since the Menzies era. Despite this support, the taxpayer
has received little in return. The return on public investment in the Ord scheme
between 1959 and 1991 was just 17 cents for every dollar, representing a financial loss
of $511 million. Despite these dire figures, a further $334 million was invested by
taxpayers since 2009 on expanding areas of irrigation. This has created around 60 jobs,
a cost of about $6 million per job.3
Governments are reluctant to learn the lessons of the Ord River scheme — that
subsidising capital intensive projects is costly and brings little by way of economic
development outside of the project area. The Northern Territory (NT) government is
enthusiastically supporting the North East Gas Interconnector (NEGI), now often
referred to as the Northern Gas Pipeline (NGP), between the Northern Territory and
eastern states, despite minimal prospects of jobs and the potential to expose the NT to
east coast gas prices. 4 The Federal and Queensland Governments’ subsidisation of the
Adani coal railway is another example.

By contrast, there are investments governments can make that are strongly supported
by economic analysis. Economic assessments reviewed in this paper show that
investments into social and environmental programs that focus on Indigenous
communities can provide large economic benefit, as well as social and environmental
improvements.
This paper reviews four economic assessments of government investment in social and
environmental programs with an indigenous focus. Most of these assessments are
based on forms of cost benefit analysis.
Cost benefit analysis is a tool to help decision-makers understand the consequences of
a policy or program. In the public policy realm, it is one practical means towards
verifying that the government is making the best possible decision — or allocation of
resources — for the public.
Cost benefit analysis measures the value of a policy for the community as a whole
through its ‘net social benefits’ — or its social benefits minus its social costs.5 Most
importantly, a cost benefit analysis attempts to measure these costs and benefits in
monetary terms, even when those outcomes are not easily quantifiable. Where
quantification is impossible or highly uncertain, analysts should state that uncertain
values exist that decision-makers need to consider against the quantified net benefits.
This then makes a decision-maker’s job of weighing up pros and cons a much simpler
one as they are directly comparable to each other.
Given this process of measuring outcomes in dollar terms, cost benefit analysis is
typically used as a tool for valuing ‘tangible’ policies or projects, such as allocating real
resources such as water, building a new railway or making investment decisions.6
However, this cost benefit approach is much more difficult to undertake when
assessing social welfare programs in which many of the presumed costs and benefits
cannot be meaningfully converted into dollar terms. For example, with outcomes such
as changed behaviour or quality of life there may be no clear-cut economic payoff.
When these social benefits are difficult to measure, then there is a high risk that their
true value will be underestimated or simply overlooked. This is not a new problem and,
given the difficulty of valuing social programs, well researched and meaningful cost
benefit analyses are all the more powerful.

Independent Cost Benefit Analysis
of the Yuendumu Mediation and
Justice Committee7
The remote community of Yuendumu — 300 kilometres northwest of Alice Springs —
is one of the largest Aboriginal communities in central Australia. Until recently,
Yuendumu was also defined by a seemingly intractable conflict between the
community’s west and south camps, which developed after demographic change and a
weakening in institutional support mechanisms for internal conflict management. In
particular, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission closed in 2003 and
then in 2010 the local Yuendumu Council was replaced with the Alice Springs based
Central Desert Regional Council.8
In 2011, Northern Territory’s chief minister reportedly stated on ABC News that the
Northern Territory government ‘had done everything it could’ to facilitate
reconciliation in Yuendumu.9
Seen by many as a last resort, locals and respected Indigenous elders established the
Yuendumu Mediation and Justice Committee (YMJC) to address the community
conflict. Thanks to the YMJC project’s use of Indigenous-led agreement processes, the
original community dispute was resolved and associated violence had dramatically
fallen by 2012.
In 2014 University of Canberra economists Professor Anne Daly and Greg Barrett
undertook a cost benefit analysis to identify and value the economic impact of the
YMJC in order to inform future government policy and funding decisions for the
project.
The cost benefit analysis was based over a 10-year period (2014–2023), with the costs
and benefits discounted back to real 2014 dollars. All estimated future values were
adjusted using a discount rate of 2 per cent — calculated from the 10-year
Commonwealth bond interest rate of 4 per cent less the inflation rate of 2 per cent.

Overall, the net present value of the YMJC was estimated at $14.1 million, which was
calculated from the total benefits of $18.5 million less $4.4 million in costs.
More specifically, the total present value of costs ($4.4 million) consisted of:


$2.4 million of costs associated with resources such as labour, vehicles and
services that were unable to be used elsewhere and therefore constituted an
opportunity cost to the community.



$1.7 million in costs for compensating YMJC members’ time and associated
costs of transport and accommodation. This was calculated based on 20 YMJC
members mediating for an average of one day per year on a mediator’s wage
of $32.68 per hour.



$0.3 million from the opportunity cost of using the Peace Park gathering area
for mediation rather than alternative community uses.

The total present value of benefits ($18.5 million) was composed of numerous social
benefits, with some of the most significant including:


$2.4 million of benefits through reallocating services provided by the Northern
Territory’s Community Justice Centre to alternative uses.



$2 million in benefits accrued through reducing Northern Territory police
numbers and costs in the Yuendumu community.



$4.1 million of benefits due to reduced imprisonment rates and related prison
conflict, as valued through costs of prison staff, services and supplies.



$3.1 million of benefits in increased productivity. This was valued from 200
children in Yuendumu increasing their productivity by 5 per cent over their 30year working life, with a median weekly income of $270.



$2.7 million worth of benefits from the increased productivity of Yuendumu
community resources and activities, such as the Yuendumu Local
Implementation Plan and other non-government projects.

In balance, these findings give an overall benefit-to-cost ratio of 4.3:1. To give some
perspective, the OECD defines a ratio below 1 as ‘poor’ and a ratio above 2 as ‘high’.10

As with all economic analysis, assumptions are important. This cost benefit analysis
method assumes a 10-year time frame, although benefits could accrue over a much
longer period. Uncertainty increases over longer time periods and cost-benefit
estimates are sensitive to changing conditions. To account for this, the authors
undertook two sensitivity analyses that assume more pessimistic conditions to test the
robustness of their conclusions. The first assumes a 50 per cent reduction in benefits
over the 10-year time period. While this brings the total present value of benefits
down to $8.1 million, the net present value of YMJC is still a positive $3.75 million and
the benefit-to-cost ratio becomes 1.9:1. The second sensitivity test uses a more
conservative discount rate of 5 per cent, which has little impact on the project overall,
with the same benefit-to-cost ratio of 4.3:1.
Overall, the report undertaken by Daly and Barret highlights the significant benefits —
over and above the costs — of the JMJC project.

Mornington Island Restorative
Justice Project Evaluation11
Mornington Island is the largest of the Wellesley Islands group in the Gulf of
Carpentaria, Queensland. In 2008, the island’s community was divided between a
decreasing number of elders who placed great value on traditional connections to land
and sea, and a growing youth population who were increasingly engaged in high levels
of substance abuse and violence.
At this same time, the federal court handed down the Native Title Determination on
the Wellesley Islands, recognising Exclusive Native Title over the majority of the land.
In this context, the Mornington Island Restorative Justice Project was established in
May 2008 as a community-based peacemaking service that is both inclusive of island
culture and conforms to criminal justice system requirements. By 2014, Mornington
Island’s crime rate had fallen, relationships with local police had improved and
residents were more willing to undertake conflict resolution.12
In April 2014, the Department of Prime Minster and Cabinet commissioned the
independent market research agency Colmar Brunton to undertake a participatory
research evaluation of the Mornington Island Restorative Justice (MIRJ) Project. The
evaluation used qualitative and quantitative surveys, participatory research, secondary
data and a cost benefit analysis to assess the overall effectiveness of the project in
meeting its objectives. The purpose of the MIRJ evaluation was to better understand
how the project affects the local community, how well it is meeting its objectives and
its cost effectiveness relative to mainstream criminal justice responses.
The report found that the MIRJ Project has been successful across a number of
measures. In qualitative terms, benefits included increased community safety and
trust, greater confidence in the mediation process, restoration of elder authority and
respect, and more appropriate responses to criminal incidents.

However, these benefits were extremely difficult to qualify in quantitative terms. As
the authors note, ‘Most people on Mornington Island feel that
mediation/peacemaking is meeting most of its goals and that it’s helping improve
community safety… However, attribution to the MIRJ Project is difficult to isolate and
prove causality’.13
At face value, the cost benefit analysis finds that the MIRJ Project costs more than
conventional justice — $689 per case versus the MIRJ cost of $1,099 per case.
However, this highlights the weaknesses of the cost benefit analysis rather than the
project. Colmar Brunton suggest that ‘there are significant benefits and cost-savings
that should be taken into account that are currently unable to be measured in dollar
terms’.14 For example, due to a limited data set and an inadequate model, they were
unable to estimate in dollar terms key benefits produced by the MIRJ Project such as
reduced crime rates and recidivism, reductions in policing costs and the higher quality
of legal proceedings.
Given the large collection of positive qualitative data on the project a more vigorous
cost benefit analysis would likely reap a more positive quantitative assessment.

Consolidated Report on Indigenous
Protected Areas following Social
Return on Investment Analyses15
In the mid 1990s, representatives of Indigenous people and the Australian government
co-developed the Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) program. An IPA is formed when
traditional owners enter into a voluntary agreement with the Australian government
to manage their land or sea country for conservation with government support.
The IPA program initially served two purposes. First, it fulfilled the government’s
commitment — under the 1994 International Union for Conservation of Nature
guidelines — to establish a comprehensive protected area system representative of
the Australian ecosystem. Second, it facilitated growing interest from Indigenous
people across Australia to reconnect with country, culture and language.
The program is managed through the Indigenous Affairs Group of the Department of
Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPM&C) and funded through the Department of the
Environment. $73.08 million was allocated to the program from 2014–2018. As of
2015, there were 72 dedicated IPAs across Australia.
In 2007, the Working on Country (WoC) program was established to create job
opportunities for Indigenous people and support traditional knowledge of and
connections with land, sea and culture. The WoC program complements the IPA
program through funding rangers to care for country. The WoC program has a funding
commitment of $335 million for 2014–2018. As of 2015, there were 108 government
funded ranger groups across Australia — employing over 1,600 Indigenous rangers —
and 50 IPA projects that involved WoC funded ranger groups.
In 2016, the DPM&C commissioned SVA Consulting to explore the nature and value of
changes resulting from investment in five IPA programs. These five programs were
Warddeken in the Northern Territory, Girringun in Queensland, Birriliburu and Matuwa
Kurrara Kurrara in Western Australia, and Minyumai in New South Wales. SVA
Consulting used the Social Return on Investment (SROI) methodology to conduct the
analysis.

The study concludes that the IPA and associated WoC programs have been hugely
successful, overcoming barriers to address Indigenous disadvantage and engaging
Indigenous Australians in meaningful employment to achieve large-scale conservation
outcomes. This success is underpinned by the alignment of Indigenous and broader
community interests and priorities.16
The SROI analysis undertaken in the report is a form of cost benefit analysis — it
examines the social, economic, cultural and environmental outcomes created and the
costs of creating them by using relevant financial proxies to estimate values.
In order to estimate the benefits derived from the IPA programs, the study first
identifies what these benefits or outcomes are through a ‘theory of change’ technique.
The outcomes are mapped across short, medium and long-term timeframes. Through
the SROI analysis, only the material outcomes — those that have been realised and are
therefore measurable — are valued.
This stage of the analysis identified a wide range of benefits. For instance, the program
greatly improved local environmental management, including better fire control,
reduced feral animal numbers and less noxious weeds, as well as monitoring of
threatened species. These improvements were essentially land management savings
for the government.
The IPA program also leveraged other economic opportunities for the communities
involved, including revenue from carbon-offset projects and third party investment in
other related projects.
There were also numerous payoffs for rangers, such as increased pride and sense of
self, stronger connection with land, better health and wellbeing, and work readiness
skills.
The more ‘intangible’ benefits were estimated through stakeholder consultation and
quantitative data and then given financial proxies based on related market prices. For
example, the value of the increase in confidence experienced by rangers was proxied
by the cost of a public speaking course.
These outcomes were then sorted in terms of relative importance and valuation filters
were applied to the financial proxies to ensure that the analysis was not over-claiming.

The analysis concluded that, from 2009–2015, government and third party investment
of $32.5 million generated social, economic, cultural and environmental outcomes
valued at $96.5 million.
SVA Consulting then generated SROI ratios through comparing the total adjusted value
of these outcomes experienced by stakeholders to the investment required to create
that value in each project. The final SROI ratios ranged from 1.5:1 in Minyumai to 3.4:1
in Warddeken.
Overall, this SROI analysis is thorough and well-researched. However, it is limited by a
lack of accurate data as well as difficulties associated with measuring intangible
outcomes. Furthermore, the SROI model used assumes that there is no continuous
change without continuous investment. That is, the outcomes last for the period of
investment only. This goes against the main premise of such community initiated
projects that the investment is not a short-term or temporary fix but, rather, has
ongoing and entrenched community impact. This assumption could therefore
underestimate the true value of the outcomes.

Prospective Cost Benefit Analysis
of Healing Centres
Colonisation and subsequent policies have had lasting detrimental impacts on
Australia’s Indigenous community. The negative effects of disruption to Indigenous
culture and cultural identity continue to be passed from generation to generation,
cumulatively leading to widespread disadvantage across the Indigenous community.
This disadvantage is reflected in high rates of incarceration and substance abuse
among Indigenous people.
Following the Australian government’s Apology to the Stolen Generations and
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in 2008, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Healing Foundation was established with the purpose of reconnecting
Indigenous people with culturally effective healing methods for trauma and loss.
In 2011–12 the Healing Foundation funded 21 Healing Initiatives across Australia.
These Healing Initiatives supported various forms of community-based healing
methods, including developing local Healing Centres (HCs). While each is unique in
practice, HCs operate on the common principles of being a physically, socially and
culturally safe and meaningful space led by Indigenous people. The activities
undertaken through HCs are broad, ranging from mental health treatment and medical
services to spiritual and cultural awareness programs and skills training for the
workplace. Many of the communities involved in the project expressed interest in
developing their own HCs that could meet their community’s particular healing needs.
In 2012, the Healing Foundation commissioned KPMG to investigate this request and
provide an insight into how to establish and operate HCs. This report found that those
Indigenous people consulted considered healing as their single most important
priority.17
Given the positive outcomes of the report, in 2013 the Healing Foundation made
funding available for 13 organisations to design and develop a HC for their respective
communities. This funding was not intended to support the ongoing operational costs
of a HC.
Then, in 2014 the Healing Foundation commissioned Deloitte Access Economics (DAE)
to estimate the potential net social benefits of these HCs as compared to the status

17

quo, in order to support a business case for further investment in the ongoing
operation of HCs.
DAE used a cost benefit analysis method to estimate these potential net benefit. This
was particularly challenging for two reasons. First, many outcomes of HC activities are
spiritual in nature and extremely difficult to value in dollar terms. Second, as none of
the benefits had been realised, DAE had to rely on other studies on similar projects to
estimate the cost-benefit ratio. As there were no extant cost benefit studies conducted
on Australian Indigenous HCs, DAE then had to rely on studies of projects that were
either based overseas or not Indigenous.18
By averaging the findings of seven of these studies and extrapolating the figures over
10-years using a discount rate of 7 per cent, DAE finds a likely average benefit cost
ratio of 4.4:1 for the new HCs. This demonstrates that community healing initiatives
have high cost benefit rations. However, given the limitations mentioned, this analysis
should not solely inform investment decisions for the relevant parties involved.

Conclusion
There is a wide range of community-led engagement programs in northern Australia
with an equally wide range of outcomes and purposes. The cost benefit analyses
discussed above highlight that well-managed and well-scoped projects deliver strong
economic returns and contribute to developing northern Australia in a way that is
sustainable and socially responsible. We note that there are no shortage of projects
that have not been well scoped or well managed in northern Australia and the field of
indigenous social investment. Management and implementation are clearly crucial to
achieving the benefits that these papers estimate.
In light of the renewed political emphasis on developing northern Australia, figuring
out what kind of development we want in the area is crucial. With cost benefit
analyses of Indigenous social programs showing that they can provide large net
economic benefits, investing more in Indigenous communities should be a priority for
governments wanting to ‘develop the North’.
