Introduction

The Catholic Women’s League Australia Inc. (CWLA) is the national peak body representing the
League’s six member organizations located throughout Australia. We are a Non-Government
Organization and have consultative (roster) status with the Economic and Social Council of the United
Nations. We are also a member of the World Union of Catholic Women’s Organizations (WUCWO).
One of CWLA’s four principle aims is to influence legislative and administrative bodies at all levels of
government in order to preserve the dignity of the human person. We therefore seek to submit a
submission to the Senate Inquiry “The Indicators of, and Impact of Regional Inequality in Australia”.

Catholic Social Justice Principles

The Catholic faith has formulated a number of principles, which are titled the Catholic Social Teaching.
These teachings cover all spheres of life including the economic, political, personal and spiritual. As
committed Catholics we believe there is much wisdom and guidance that can be gained by all via the
practical application of the principles. The relevant teachings to the current Senate inquiry are as follows:

a.

Dignity of the Human Person

The dignity of every human being is the foundation of Catholic Social Teaching independent of ethnicity,
creed, gender, sexuality, age or ability. Thus, every person in Australia has the same rights regardless of
whether they live in urban or regional areas;
b.

Subsidiarity and Participation

This Catholic Social Teaching teaches us that all human beings have the right to participate in decisions
that affect their lives. Thus, it is important that in this particular Senate Inquiry, the voices and opinions
of the people living in regional areas of Australia are taken into consideration in any policy or legislation
that is formulated as a result;
c.

The Common Good

This teaching relates to the principle that when we work together to improve the wellbeing of people in
our society and the wider world, then the common good is achieved. Thus, we need to work for the
common good in supporting people living in regional areas, even if the people making decisions affecting
their lives may not necessarily live in those regions; and
d.

Solidarity

We believe that we all belong to one human family regardless of our differences. Thus, we all have an
obligation to promote the rights and development of people across the country, whether they live in urban
or regional areas.

Human Rights Framework

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights details the specific human rights articles that relates to the
issues discussed in this submission:
a.

Article 23 (1) states that “everyone has the right to free choice of employment, to just and

favourable conditions of work and protection against unemployment;
b.

Article 25 (1) states that “everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health

and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and
necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability,
widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control; and
c.

Article 26 (1) states that everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in

the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and
professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible
to all on the basis of merit.

Poverty in Rural Australia

The reality is that there are higher levels of poverty in rural Australia compared to urban areas. In 2015
to 2016 the equivilised average disposable household income outside Australia’s capital cities was on
average 18 percent less ($880 versus $1,072 in capital cities). Net household worth was on average 29
percent lower ($737,000 versus $1,033,000). People living outside capital cities were more likely to sit
in the lowest household income quintile, i.e. 25 versus 18 percent.
The Local Government Areas with the lowest median household incomes are exclusively located in
regional areas. The 100 LGAs with greatest proportion of people earning less than $500 per week were
almost exclusively living in regional areas1.
Thus, it is evident that the highest rates of poverty in Australia are located in rural areas.

Increase of Sexual Harassment to Women Living in Regional Areas

Recently, two of our members attended the Committee on the Status of Women 62 at the United Nations
in New York. One of the lectures they attended was titled “Grace Under Fire” Sexual Harassment and
Violence in Rural Australia”, presented by the Associated Country Women of the World. This lecture
focused on the research of Dr Skye Saunders who studied this issue. After interviewing thousands of
women in relation to this topic she found that 73% of the women interviewed had experienced harassment
in the workplace. She spoke about stories that highlighted that casual misogyny, often passed off as
banter, can be found in rural areas and is so rampant that it is becoming normalized and difficult to
identify. This type of behavior is particularly rife in traditionally male dominated occupations such as
mining and agriculture. The more remote women are, the more important it is that their voices are heard.
It is evident that the most effective cure is to prevent the problem from happening in the first place, and
this can occur via creating effective policies and working to change attitudes. One approach to combat
this issue was via education, using a three pronged approach. The first prong should be targeting men
and resetting their ideas about what a normal workplace should look like.
The second target should be to educate females so that they can improve their capacity to understand the
level of safety that they are entitled to and have the strength and ability to ensure that they receive this
safety. One of our members has commented that it is incumbent on both males and females to take
responsibility for what happens in their lives and to have a greater understanding of how they contribute
towards creating a solution. One cannot view the issue of sexual harassment as solely a blaming game
but as an issue that everyone needs to address.
The last target is employers, so that they can understand their obligations to their employees. A strong
emphasis should also be placed on programs to empower young women and primary prevention as a
long-term approach to change the negative masculinity culture. Furthermore, employers and various
stakeholders need to know their obligations, and need to be educated in such a way that they will want
to take steps to complete their obligations to their employees. Women themselves need to improve their
capacity to understand the level of safety that she is entitled to and build up her standards, so that she
doesn’t accept anything less than what she is entitled to and is able to give a voice to her own values.

Health

According to one source2, the health status of remote Australians is worse than both city and rural
populations on almost every indicator.
a.

Risk Factors are Higher in Rural Australia

More Australians smoke, drink to excess, are obese and inactive in regional Australia compared to their
urban counterparts3. One of our members who lives in a regional area has noted that “alcohol is ruining
the lives of all young people, male and female, and this is an issue that should be addressed”. These
elements have been found to contribute to ill health and the development of chronic disease, including
diabetes, heart disease and other diseases;
b.

The Proportion of People Living with Ill Health is Higher in Regional Areas

The most recent reports estimate that 20% more people in remote areas are living with disease when
compared with those living in major cities. More than one third of remote Australian adults, i.e. 37%,
live with untreated decay compared with approximately 23% in major cities4.
c.

In Remote Australia, the Death Rate is Higher

Death rates relating to major causes of death are significantly higher in remote communities compared
with major cities. Almost five times more deaths occur in remote Australia. Three times the number of
deaths relating to diabetes. Twice the number of deaths in Australia occur in remote Australia. 60% of
people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and who die of these deaths are in remote Australia.
40% more deaths from coronary heart disease are in remote Australia. And the lung cancer death rate is
40% more deaths in remote Australia.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 85

Although it is clear that Australians living in regional areas have higher needs, accessibility to health care
services is lower. Remote Australia has the lowest numbers of health professionals providing health
services. There is 20% less Medicare funded GP activity in regional areas compared with the same
population in the city. There are 80% less specialists in remote Australia compared to the major cities.
Remote Australia has access to only one third of the number of dentists of major cities.
The expenditure on Medicare shows that the relative spend per individual through the Medicare Benefits
Schedule is $910 in major cities and $536 in remote areas in 2014-20155.
More people, such as retirees and young people seeking better living options for their families, are
moving to regional areas. Although populations might grow it is imperative that adequate health care is
provided and be made available to those who need them. Specialist care often involves expensive and
time-consuming travel for those who need it. One member has observed that the Isolated Patients Travel
Assistance Scheme is “inadequate and the paperwork cumbersome” and that “it is very difficult to get
air travel approved, the levels of reimbursement is inadequate – the scheme is in urgent need of review”.

7.

Education

One of our members who lives in a regional area has observe that students in regional areas typically
have reduced opportunities at all levels, from preschool to tertiary levels. Transport is problematic for
children living on farms, and the time spent on travel and chores probably contribute to poor academic
outcomes. Being allocated a few extra points to enable entry into university sounds like a positive step
forward but unfortunately this approach may set rural students up for failure when they enter universities
and find themselves competing against better prepared city students. The range of courses that are
available at regional TAFE colleges is limited and not comprehensive as a course may only be available,
for example, 300 kilometres from where the student actually lives. Young people cannot afford travel
and accommodation as the levels of assistance are not realistic for living away from home and the socioeconomic disadvantage thus becomes intergenerational.

Transport

Given the distances that people in regional and rural areas have to travel, transport is an obvious issue
that requires funding and support. For example, one member of CWLA noted that the NSW state
government has cut the number of trains from the North Coast (which is the area where the member lives)
to and from Sydney from three to two per day. She is aware of the case of one man who travels to Sydney
each Friday to receive medical treatment in Sydney. Because of the paucity of transport options he is
forced to spend two nights in Sydney instead of one. Furthermore, the early morning services have been
dropped. This case highlights the problems that lack of transport can present and highlights the reality
isolating people from the services they need is not helpful to those living in regional areas or for their
families.

9.

Employment

There is a lack of job opportunities for people living in rural areas. The reality is that not every person
living in these areas is suited to working in agriculture or mining, yet very little has been done to
decentralise government jobs and provide opportunities for people living in regional areas. For example,
many of the jobs in the banking industry, which attracted both genders no longer exist. If there were good
jobs available, young people might aspire to stay in the regional areas and raise their families there, thus
reducing pressure in the cities and regenerating country centres.

Conclusion

It is evident from the information provided in this submission that the needs of people living in regional
areas are not being met in terms of protection for women in terms of sexual harassment; education;
employment; transportation; poverty issues and health. These are just some of a large spectrum of issues
which people living in regional areas face. The government, both federal and state/territorial need to
focus on dedicating more resources and funds to supporting people living in regional areas. It is important
to note that by increasing transport and other services this can only help to promote the benefits of living
in regional communities.
We wish you well in your deliberations.
