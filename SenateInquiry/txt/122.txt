Dear Senator Ketter
INQUIRY INTO THE INDICATORS OF, AND IMPACT OF REGIONAL INEQUALITY IN AUSTRALIA
On behalf of Charles Sturt University, I am pleased to respond to the Economic References Committee
inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of regional inequality in Australia.
Charles Sturt University is Australia’s largest regional university, with more than 43,000 students and
approximately 2,100 FTE staff. Established in 1989, the University traces its origins to the formation of the
Bathurst Experimental Farm and Wagga Wagga Experimental Farm in the 1890s. In one form or another,
research, innovation and education has been integral to the University’s character and mission for more
than a century.
Charles Sturt University is a unique multi-campus institution with campuses at Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst,
Canberra, Dubbo, Goulburn, Manly, Orange, Parramatta, Port Macquarie and Wagga Wagga, as well as
various study centres located throughout regional and rural south-eastern Australia.
The University’s commitment to the development and sustainability of rural and regional Australia is
informed by the unique research focus undertaken, and the partnerships it has formed with each of its
campus’ local communities, local industry, and with the broader regions it serves.
Charles Sturt University offers a comprehensive suite of research and academic training programs that
focus on addressing rural and regional labour market needs, growing regional economies, and preparing
students for the jobs of the new economy through rural and regional Australia.
Over the last year or so, Charles Sturt University has provided extensive commentary and opinion by way
of submission to a range of parliamentary and departmental inquiries, across the Australian, New South
Wales and Victorian Governments relating to regional economies and the options available to strengthen
the economic, social and environmental resilience of Australia’s regional cities, rural towns and remote
communities.
In many cases, the commentary provided in our submissions has examined the impact of regional
inequality in Australia, including within regions, between regions and between regional Australia and our
major metropolitan centres. Further, the recommendations we have put forward in our submissions have
included many suggestions for addressing regional inequality and what indicators should be measured to
ensure success in this endeavour.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

In particular, I would like to draw the Committee’s attention to Charles Sturt University’s comprehensive
submission on regional development and decentralisation that was prepared for the House of
Representatives Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation in September last
year, Charles Sturt University – Submission - Inquiry into Regional Development and Decentralisation,
House of Representatives - Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, 15
September 2017. The commentary and recommendations put forward in this Submission will be of value
to the Committee in its inquiry into the indicators of, and impact of regional inequality in Australia. A
summary of our regional development and decentralisation submission is provided herein.
Charles Sturt University’s submission to the Select Committee, outlined the University’s perspective of the
opportunities for and challenges to regional development and decentralisation in Australia. While our
specific commentary and recommendations in the Submission were drawn from our century-plus
experience, research, knowledge and skills in development of regional, rural and remote communities in
southern New South Wales and northern Victoria, our commentary and recommendations are directly
applicable to the development of all non-metropolitan Australia.
Charles Sturt University’s believe that genuine, bipartisan commitment across all tiers of government to
the coordinating of the long-term strategies and actions of economic, social and environmental
stakeholders in any given region, will deliver positive outcomes and great benefit for Australians living in
regional, rural and remote communities, including:
i.

growing regional populations to ensure internationally competitive relevance, increased
standard of living and improved quality of life;

ii.

sharing economic, social and environmental access and equity between regional and
metropolitan Australia;

iii.

enabling world-class experiences, cutting-edge skills development and global-knowledge
transfer for people living in the regions;

iv.

increasing participation and productivity rates in regional economies, while concomitantly
reducing future economic risk through diversification;

v.

attracting and retaining private and public-sector investment, including foreign investment in
the industries and infrastructure needs of the future;

vi.

enhancing the vibrancy, cohesiveness and engagement of regional communities, particularly
regional cities and rural towns; and,

vii.

positioning regional cities, not just as local service centres, but as places with unique value
propositions and competitive advantages on a national and an international scale.

1. Charles Sturt University recommends that a regional development framework with the seven
outcomes detailed above be agreed through a national partnership comprising all levels of
government and that pragmatic and measurable goals and objectives be attached to each
outcome.
Delivering positive outcomes and great benefit for Australians living and working in regional, including
indicators of and actions for addressing inequality in regional, rural and remote settings will require
rigorous system integration, that is:
i.

holistic, with long-term policy focus and program effort on the strategies, actions and tasks
required to deliver regional, rural and remote development benefit;

ii.

built on strongly facilitated participation by all economic, social, cultural and environmental
stakeholders in any given region that drives a very high level of distinguishing regionalism;
3

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

iii.

based on shared regional vision and leadership, with whole of stakeholder agreement and
commitment to definable and measurable economic, social, cultural and environmental
outcomes;

iv.

governed and coordinated at the regional level, with management and operationalisation
distributed to the communities that comprise each region;

v.

guided by a planning, reporting and communication framework, including an overall regional
development strategy containing economic, social, cultural and environmental roadmaps and
investment plans, including capital sources and public-sector budgets;

vi.

owned and championed by individual members of the community (at local, think global –
“glocal”); and,

vii.

a market-based response, where government intervention is strictly in the public good and
within the scope of an overall regional development strategy, for example, only decentralising
government agencies where there is positive net benefit and investing in trade facilitation
rather than subsidising corporate decentralisation.

To this end, Charles Sturt University’s principal recommendations to boost the performance of Australia’s
regional, rural and remote development efforts, including indicators of and actions for addressing
inequality in regional, rural and remote settings is to rigorously strengthen system integration.
2. Charles Sturt University, recommends that – arm’s length, bipartisan, beyond cycle and
resourced and championed governance and management model be implemented as follows:
a. Through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and including Local Government
Association (LGA), the Commonwealth would establish the Australian Regional
Development Commission, the Commission would report to COAG, national plan Regions
2030 Unlocking Opportunity could provide the foundations on which to build this.
b. The Commission would be funded 50/50 by the Commonwealth, States and Territories and
would work with bodies such as Infrastructure Australia and the Rural Industries Research
and Development Corporation (RIRDC), with initial seed funding over four years of $10
billion.
c. Commissioners would be nominated Australia’s Regional Development Australia
Committees (RDAs) and appointed by a COAG Regional Development Ministerial Council,
while the RDAs would be resourced to operate as locally-championed regional branches of
the Commission.
d. The Commission would be headquartered in regional Australia, located in Orange or Dubbo
as geographically they are in the centre of regional eastern Australia.
e. The RDAs would be resourced to continue and improve their regional planning work, based
on the framework set out above and would have greater involvement from rural and remote
communities in each area, thereby creating a genuine hub and spoke with a regional city at
its core.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

Successful regional development strategy, action and task implementation will require investment in
infrastructure from road, rail and aviation, through to social and cultural service provision and information
technology and communications. Above all else, equitable and accessible world-class communications
infrastructure will be required to develop our regional, rural and remote communities in the digital age of
the 21st Century will be essential to resolve the indicators of and actions for addressing inequality in
regional, rural and remote settings.
Upgrading of the National Broadband Network (NBN) scope, so that very high speed, fibre to the home
broadband can be delivered throughout regional, rural and remote Australia will be essential to catalyse
growth of our regions and address inequality. It will also be crucial to ensure that Australian’s living in
regional, rural and remote Australians have the same economic, social, cultural and environmental
opportunities as Australians living in metropolitan centres. World-class broadband services are also
essential to ensure regional wellbeing through access and equity in education, healthcare, government
and financial services.
3. Charles Sturt University recommends an immediate, independent review of the NBN project be
undertaken and that the NBN roll-out be significantly strengthened to ensure top-10 OECD ranking
fibre to the home broadband services be made available to all Australians living in regional, rural
and remote communities and that fibre to the CBD’s of each regional city in Australia be increased
to 1GBs.
All regions, including most metropolitan centres, with the possible exception of the outer ring suburban
areas of Australia’s largest cities, are generally well-serviced by physical infrastructure such as roads,
utilities and aviation as well as social infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and tertiary education and
training providers. While gaps exist, there are examples, particularly in regional Australia of infrastructure
investments being made before population demands justified expenditure. Infrastructure investment by
both the public and private sectors must be driven by the needs of a growing population.
Through organisations such as Infrastructure Australia and the Government’s City Deals initiatives,
population growth in any given region provides the business case for investment and is generally
delivered as and when it is required by the community. As Australia’s regions grow so will infrastructure
investment, the key is for the economic, social, cultural and environmental stakeholders in any given
region to work together to grow the population to justify continued investment in infrastructure as a means
to addressing infrastructure-created inequality.
Decentralisation of public sector organisations can play a vital role in the development of our regional
cities but should only be undertaken where it fits with well thought through strategies and detailed plans
based on cost-benefit analysis that contributes to each region’s given strengths.
While Charles Sturt University believes there is a role for governments in facilitating the involvement of
national and multinational firms in regional cities, we do not support government resources being directed
to the decentralisation of private firms.
It is all about what fits best with regional strategies and plans and communicating the unique mix to attract
organisations. A market-based response. It is about competitiveness of a region to attract, not for
governments subsidise business or act as lender of last resort. Public investment in regional development
must focus on enhancing competitiveness, particularly public good infrastructure, such technology and
social services. We support governments playing a role in investment attraction but not in taking on or
sharing investment risk. Such an approach will be essential to achieve sustained reduction in regional
inequality.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

4. Charles Sturt University recommends:
a. government investment in regional development be restricted to public good and public
accessible activities, including economic, social, cultural and environmental infrastructure,
such as technology, transport, education and training and health; and,
b. government provide funding, through the regional development governance and
management mechanisms detailed above and through industry departments for the
purposes of private sector investment attraction and facilitation, including foreign direct
investment, while;
c. government must ensure that it does not use tax payers’ funds to share or subsidise
private sector risk or be trapped into acting as a lender of last resort to the private sector
under any circumstances.
Drawing on our Charles Sturt University – Submission - Inquiry into Regional Development and
Decentralisation, House of Representatives - Select Committee on Regional Development and
Decentralisation and our other recent parliamentary and departmental submissions detailed at Attachment
1, we have provided an extensive and detailed range of recommendations that we believe would
contribute to addressing the indicators of and mitigating the effects of regional inequality in Australia.
Specifically, our recommendations would position the regional cities, rural towns and remote communities
within the University’s footprint for better economic, social and environmental outcomes which in turn
would reduce, if not eliminate, regional inequality. Our recommendations are equally relevant to cities,
towns and communities beyond our footprint in New South Wales and Victoria, as well as the rest of nonmetropolitan Australia.
I would along with relevant Charles Sturt University representatives would be delighted to provide further
information to the Committee and would be available to provide evidence at any proposed hearings that
you may undertake in relation to considering the merits of the addressing inequality between Australia’s
regional, rural and remote communities and our metropolitan centres.
Yours sincerely

Vice-Chancellor

Inquiry into Perinatal Services in Victoria
Family and Community Development Committee
14 July 2018
1.

Recommendations
Charles Sturt University recommends the following with regards the improvement of
perinatal services in Victoria:

1.1

The availability, quality and safety of health services delivering services to
women and their babies during the perinatal period
Charles Sturt University recommends, as a first step to enhancing perinatal
services in Victoria, that the State Government:

1.2



make access to the State’s birthing statistical data bases open to the
public with no charge; and,



that the State Government put greater resources and effort into
understanding Victoria’s perinatal service requirements, including
collection and analysis of birthing data for informed, evidenced-based
decision making.

The impact that the loss of commonwealth funding (in particular, the National
Perinatal Depression Initiative) will have on Victorian hospitals and medical
facilities as well as on the health and wellbeing of Victorian families
Charles Sturt University recommends that the Victorian Government advocate
for reinstatement and full funding of the National Perinatal Depression Initiative
by the Commonwealth.
Furthermore, as part of reinstating the Initiative, Charles Sturt University
recommends that the State Government, whether in conjunction with the
Commonwealth and/or in its own right make further resources available to:

1.3



boost availability of staff trained in perinatal depression identification
and management;



enhance perinatal depression training resources and the delivery of
perinatal depression training with public vocational and higher
education providers and in health institutions; and,



clarify and effectively communicate perinatal depression screening
protocols.

The adequacy of the number, location, distribution, quality and safety of health
services capable of dealing with high-risk and premature births in Victoria

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 9 of 40

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

Refer recommendation at Section 4.1(b) as a first step in addressing the
adequacy of the number, location, distribution, quality and safety of health
services capable of dealing with high-risk and premature births in Victoria.
1.4

The quality, safety and effectiveness of current methods to reduce the
incidence of maternal and infant mortality and premature births
Refer recommendation at Section 4.1(b) as a first step in addressing the
quality, safety and effectiveness of current methods to reduce the incidence of
maternal and infant mortality and premature births in Victoria.

1.5

Access to and provision of an appropriately qualified workforce, including
midwives, paediatricians, obstetricians, general practitioners, anaesthetists,
maternal and child health nurses, mental health practitioners and lactation
consultants across Victoria
Charles Sturt University recommends that the Victorian Government make
funding available to substantial grow the perinatal services workforce in
Victoria to ensure that the State’s perinatal service workforce is appropriately
qualified and operates at world’s-best standards. This would include, amongst
program elements, the following:

1.6



establishment of a centre for regional, rural and remote midwifery
practice in collaboration with Charles Sturt University’s and La Trobe
University’s Murray Darling Medical School to deliver teaching and
learning for the development of the midwifery profession and provide
an industry research function, thereby providing the evidence base for
governments to make policy decisions and develop and implement
programs to enhance perinatal services in regional Australia;



engaging Charles Sturt University to design, develop and deliver a
“midwife practitioner” course at Master’s degree level, that would
provide highly specialised midwives to work as independent midwives,
particularly in regional, rural and remote areas of Victoria; and,



engaging Charles Sturt University to design, develop and deliver a
“child health nurse” course, that would provide highly specialised child
health nurses, particularly in regional, rural and remote areas of
Victoria.

Disparity in outcomes between rural and regional and metropolitan locations;
and,
Charles Sturt University recommends, as a first step to enhancing perinatal
services in regional, rural and remote Victoria, that the State Government:


make access to the State’s perinatal statistical data bases open to the
public with no charge; and,



that the State Government put greater resources and effort into
understanding regional, rural and remote Victoria’s perinatal service

requirements, including collection and analysis of birthing data for
informed, evidenced-based decision making.
Furthermore, by adopting our recommendation at Section 4.5(b), Charles Sturt
University, through the Murray Darling Medical School, could provide the
Victorian Government with the capability and capacity to collect and analyse
data on perinatal services in regional, rural and remote Victoria which would
provide an evidence base from which governments can make sound policy
decisions and design effective programs for service enhancement.
1.7

Identification of best practice.
Charles Sturt University recommends that the Victorian Government invest in a
through and detailed analysis of perinatal best practice that draws on
Victorian, Australian and international experience, and that such an investment
include comparison of perinatal service best practice across metropolitan,
regional, rural and remote communities to underwrite evidence based decision
making.
Furthermore, by adopting our recommendation at Section 4.5(b), Charles Sturt
University, through the Murray Darling Medical School, could provide the
Victorian Government with the capability and capacity to collect and analyse
perinatal best practice services across Victorian, Australian and international
regional, rural and remote communities.

School to Work Transition
Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training
2 August 2018
1.

Recommendations
Charles Sturt University provides recommendations on nine key elements of
Australia’s school to work transition system, our recommendations are aimed at
improving policy outcomes from and boosting program outputs of Australia’s school
to work system for the future success of all young Australians.

1.1

School to work transition policy outcomes
Charles Sturt University believes that transition from school to work policy outcomes
must:

1.2



provide access to all;



enable individualisation of solutions;



address generic problem-solving;



engage the community – whole of student support system; and,



guarantee benefit, at both the individual, institutional and community level
that:
o

recognise and accept credentials authorising entry into career
opportunities or postsecondary education programs;

o

placement or acceptance in post secondary vocational training and higher
education programs;

o

placement in competitive or supported employment; and,

o

participation in continuing and adult education, adult services, and
independent living in community settings.

School to work transition program design
Charles Sturt University believes success in transition from school to work program
design, development and implementation aimed at meeting the aforementioned
policy outcomes, relies on:


pathways that deliver strong social capital in communities;



transition programs that enhance the work skills and dispositions of young
Australians to work – making them ‘work ready’;

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 12 of 40

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

1.3



transition programs that develop significant human capital capabilities in
young people which enable them to assume positions in the workplace more
readily and with better outcomes for employers;



ensuring considerable benefits to all parties involved in placing young people
in quality programs that support the transition from school to work are
realised;



employers and potential employees being encouraged to trial an industry or
company to ascertain if it was their preference;



considering the demands of local sites, different opportunities are available
for all stakeholders;



involving considerable effort from schools and industry;



providing options for addressing skill shortage, nationally but also locally;



acknowledging that economic benefits are long term and should be built into
the long-term planning of potential employers; and



acknowledging that rural Australia may be particularly disadvantaged in
offering options for transitioning young people from school to work as there
are often limited options available in some towns for employment.

School to work transition program outputs
Charles Sturt University believes success in transition from school to work program
interventions, or actions, incorporated into the design and development of school to
work transition programs, must facilitate the following seven system outputs:
1. economic and education fundamentals as the foundation for good outcomes.
2. reduction in early school leaving as it is more efficient and effective than
treating disengagement at a later stage.
3. rapid responses to disengagement.
4. formal participation requirements to drive effective responses for improving
outcomes.
5. Individualised approaches, but recognise they are more expensive to deliver.
6. Solutions that are driven locally as they tend to be more sustainable and
effective.
7. Integrated responses that help reduce confusion amongst participants and
are more efficient and effective.

School to work transition stakeholder responsibilities

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 13 of 40

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

Charles Sturt University believes the development of work or study ‘readiness’ must
be a joint responsibility of all stakeholders with definition of the roles and
responsibilities and the theme of collaboration and partnership between schools,
families and employers required:

1.5



Schools (and families) predominantly have responsibility for assisting young
people to start the development of Foundation Skills and Knowledge and Selfunderstanding.



Some exposure to Broad Industry Understanding can take place at school,
but that it requires the input of employers and industry.



Tertiary education providers and employers are responsible for helping young
people to develop Occupation-specific Skills and Knowledge.



Employers are responsible supporting the development of Workplace-specific
Skills and Knowledge, including making expectations of workplace behaviour
and performance clear to young people.

School to work transition priority areas
Charles Sturt University believes that there are three broad priority areas for
facilitating a successful transition from compulsory education to full-time work:
1. Getting educational fundamentals right:
o

Developing literacy and numeracy skills in early school years.

o

Strong and effective school leadership.

o

A robust curriculum.

o

High standards of teacher quality and effective accountability.

o

Appropriate recognition of school and student disadvantage in funding
arrangements.

2. Promoting engagement and ensuring streamlined services are available for
young people who are disengaged from employment, education and training:
o

Dealing more quickly with young people that become disengaged.

o

Creating integrated responses to promote engagement and facilitate reengagement and in delivering such integrated responses managed their
delivery in an accountability framework that answers:
 Who should fund the elements and what level of funding certainty
should be provided?
 Whether the elements should be re-focused in any way, including
eligibility criteria and target clients?
 How to manage the transition from a National Partnership context?

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 14 of 40

Submission 122

3. Engaging business to increase opportunities and enhance the employability
of young people:
o

1.6

Schools, the community and businesses need to work together in
partnerships to create opportunities for successful transitions to
meaningful employment.

School to work transition system governance
Charles Sturt University believes driving positive school to work transition will require
effective system governance that involves all stakeholders in agreeing policy
outcomes and setting program outputs, including:

1.7



A clear scope and agenda for its operation.



Funding and secretariat support to enable data collection, analysis and
dissemination.



Fewer meetings of higher value, including one face-to-face meeting focused
on the annual reporting of data/trends and interpretation from experts in the
field.



A continued commitment to openness of discussion and sensitivity to specific
jurisdictional contexts.



A forum for responding to emerging policy issues and priorities.

School to work transition measurement and reporting
Charles Sturt University believes that measuring and reporting will be crucial and that
effective measuring and reporting should provide a basis for evidence-based
decision making in the governance of Australia’s school to work transition system,
however to deliver effective system measurement and reporting and number of
barriers will need to be addresses, including:


the widespread lack of understanding and confidence in how to measure
these school to work transition capabilities at the individual, institutional and
community wide level in a way that is authentic and meaningful;



concerns about what the results of the assessment of these capabilities might
be used for and that this might further disadvantage those who are already
struggling, or that results may not be interpreted accurately by employers,
perhaps for diagnostic or self-reflection purposes rather than for summative
reporting; and,



no point in establishing a benchmark for certain capabilities if there are not
mechanisms in place for helping students to reach those benchmarks.

1.8

An effective policy framework for school to work transition
In summary, Charles Sturt University proposes a school to work transition policy
framework that we believe would deliver positive results at the individual, institutional
and community level, our five-part framework includes:
1. Workplace specific skills and knowledge.
2. Occupation specific skills and knowledge.
3. Broad industry understanding, including career pathways and necessary
attributes and skills.
4. Self-understanding, including an understanding of own strengths,
weaknesses and interests and how these might relate to work, as well as an
ability to manage own behaviour in a work situation.
5. Foundation skills and knowledge, not only literacy and numeracy skills, but
also skills that provide a foundation for applying technical knowledge and
skills, (such as digital literacy, learning, problem solving, innovation,
communication and reflection skills) and a basic understanding of the world of
work.

1.9

An operative program design for school to work transition
Finally, Charles Sturt University proposes a school to work transition program design
that we believe would deliver positive results at the individual, institutional and
community level, our 10-part design includes:
1. Effective assessment.
2. Real communication and active motivation.
3. Fitness for purpose.
4. Value for money.
5. Logistics – including technological considerations and professional
development needed for teachers and other stakeholders to deliver.
6. Reliability – training and education consistency and assessment over time.
7. Validity – drawing upon many sources of evidence.
8. Fairness – by avoiding any bias created by elements that are not being
assessed (such as lack of familiarity with the language or context).
9. Credibility – amongst those who have a stake in the outcomes of the
assessment.
10. Simplicity and clarity.

Independent Review Regional, Rural and Remote Education
Australian Government
29 August 2018
2.

Recommendations
Charles Sturt University recommends the following with regard strengthening
Australia’s regional, rural and remote education system for better economic, social
and environmental outcomes for students and our communities across Australia:

2.1

The gap in educational achievement between regional, rural and remote
students and metropolitan students
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:


That student aspiration and capability built in and through schools be
recognised as essential for regional, rural and remote educational
outcomes and that governments directly invest in this area of comparative
market failure (when compared to metropolitan outcomes).



That educational pathway options for regional, rural and remote students
be greatly expanded to materially deliver access and equity gains for nonmetropolitan Australians. Refer to recommendations provided by Charles
Sturt University in submission to the Senate Education and Training
Committee Inquiry of 7 July 2017 regarding the proposed Higher Education
Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and
Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017).



The design, development and delivery by higher education training
providers of a greater range of Bachelor programs that articulate from
vocational education and training (VET) diplomas and Certificate 4s,
including greater integration between levels 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Australian
Qualification Framework (AQF), including amendment of National
Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011 (NVR) and Tertiary
Education Quality Standards Agency (TEQSA) regulations to enable nesting
of VET and higher education qualifications and vice versa.



That Government, Schools and tertiary education continue to focus and
investment in participation and success programs by government, schools
and tertiary education and training providers, including continuation and
expansion of HEPPP, particularly in regional, rural and remote Australia.
Again refer recommendations provided by Charles Sturt University in
submission to the Senate Education and Training Committee Inquiry of 7
July 2017 regarding the proposed Higher Education Support Legislation
Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher
Education System) Bill 2017).

2.2

The key barriers and challenges that impact on the educational outcomes of
regional, rural and remote students, including aspirations and access issues

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 19 of 40

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:




That governments design and implement funded programs that support
pathways for non-traditional students in regional, rural and remote
Australia, building on the successful interventions and learnings of the
University.
That governments design and implement pathway programs that build on
the regional retention results of the Graduate Outcomes Survey and the
crucial role the University plays in developing and securing skills for the
regional workforce, which in turn supports the viability of regional
businesses and communities.



That governments provide additional funding for the University to work with
schools and their communities in promoting the benefits of, and developing
aspiration for, higher education across non-metropolitan Australia. This
work has been demonstrated to be a prime influence in the increasing
number of university enrolments by regional, rural and remote students
reported in the national data.



That governments provide additional support and funding to enable higher
education to provide role models (for example, university academics,
graduates working in the community, and non-metropolitan focused
teaching, learning and research institutes such as the proposed Murray
Darling Medical School), noting that for universities to be able to continue
to influence regional secondary students in this crucial area public funding
will be required.



That to provide an appropriate evidence base, government support and
expand Charles Sturt University’s pilot research into the barriers and
challenges that impact on the educational outcomes of regional, rural and
remote students (CIN Educational Consulting & Charles Sturt University,
Office of Indigenous Affairs). This work would include aspirations and
access issues to address this as a first step to enabling all regional, rural,
remote school leaders, onsite access to contextually relevant, face-to-face
professional learning and on-going support.



That governments, collectively utilise individual rural and remote schools
as the contextual centre for professional development for principals and
school executives. Such work would include ongoing and professional
support, delivered by experienced rural and remote education experts
insitu.



That State governments partner with universities, such as Charles Sturt, to
prepare and accredit professional development for educators specifically
for rural and remote school leadership in rural and remote communities
throughout Australia, this would include pre-teaching appointment and ongoing insitu professional development and mentoring.



The Review team examine Charles Sturt University’s early research
findings referred to herein and conduct consultations within the pilot
communities that this nascent work is being undertaken in, as well as
request the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training to
partner with the University to progress this research enquiry for tailored,

Submission 122

contextualised and insitu professional development of rural and remote
educators for improvement of student learning outcomes (CIN Educational
Consulting & Charles Sturt University, Office of Indigenous Affairs).
2.3

The appropriateness and effectiveness of current modes of education
delivered to these students, including the use of information and
communications technology and the importance of face to face regional, rural
and remote education provision
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:


That the Commonwealth Government, as a matter of national urgency,
immediately review, refine and revise its information technology and
communications policies, to ensure that all Australians, including those in
regional, rural and remote Australia have world’s-best access to the
internet.



To this end, the Commonwealth Government’s national broadband network
initiative be expanded to provide full fibre (or equivalent) to the home for
all regional, rural and remote Australians, noting that failure to do so will
consign non-metropolitan Australia to great education disadvantage and
irrelevance in the digital century.



That technology and communications related initiatives in the
Commonwealth Government’s Regions 2030 Unlocking Opportunity policy
statement be revised to reflect the two recommendations above, and that
following revision of the policy statement and our two recommendations
above be funded in full and implemented as a matter of priority to ensure a
viable future for regional, rural and remote Australia.



That technology and communications related initiatives in the
Commonwealth Government’s Regions 2030 Unlocking Opportunity policy
statement be revised to reflect the two recommendations above, and that
follow revision the policy statement and our two recommendations above
by funded in full and implemented as a matter of priority to ensure a viable
future for regional, rural and remote Australia.



That government devise new and effective ways of financing information
technology and communications access, hardware and software for
regional, rural and remote students and their family’s that consider the
often very short life spans of technology products, noting that current
public funding models to do not take into account the useful life of
technology, and therefore subject regional, rural and remote students to
additional disadvantage over their metropolitan peers.



Finally, Charles Sturt University supports the recommendations provided
by Mr Craig Petersen, the Principal of Denison College of Secondary
Education and Deputy President of the New South Wales Secondary
Principal’s Council, in his submission to the Independent Review of
Regional, Rural and Remote Education.

Also, refer to recommendations in Section 1.5 below.

2.4

The effectiveness of public policies and programs that have been implemented
to bridge the divide
Charles Sturt University supports the recommendations provided by Mr Craig
Petersen, the Principal of Denison College of Secondary Education and Deputy
President of the New South Wales Secondary Principal’s Council, in his
submission to the Independent Review of Regional, Rural and Remote
Education.
Charles Sturt University has made a number of other recommendations in
Section 4.5, that we believe would strengthen effectiveness of public policies
and programs that have been implemented to bridge the divide between
regional, rural and remote education outcomes and those of metropolitan
Australia.

2.5

The gaps and opportunities to help students successfully transition from
school to further study, training and employment
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:
1. Development of complementary investment in soft resources that leverage
the use of existing hard resource facilities in regional Australia.
2. An agile funding model that removes barriers to cross-sector collaboration
and rewards engagement with community and industry. In particular, a
dedicated strategy to enable education providers to develop seamless
transitions between Vocational Education and Training and Higher
Education providers (Acer: credit based pathways in tertiary education)
(NCVER; a half-open door: pathways for VET award holders into Australian
universities 2013), including:


a continuing focus on implementing the Australian Qualifications
Framework (AQF) operational guidelines for pathways, in particular
working towards guaranteed entry into Higher Education courses
for VET award holders;



combined educational leadership from all three sectors, with
dedicated, senior roles that hold responsibility for collaboration and
education pathways;



investment in systems to monitor student progress and
achievements within and between all three sectors (enabled through
the Universal Student Identifier (USI); and,



accessible, well-structured information about pathway options for
students and key influencers (including parents and careers
counsellors).

3. A model that has a core function of maximising the use of technology and
capacity building around digital service delivery in a way that addresses
disparities in regional capacity and ability (Morgan, 2016) and addresses
CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 22 of 40

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

substantial growth in regional to metropolitan migration for Higher Education
study (a 75 per cent increase between 2008 – 2014) (National Centre for
Student Equity in Higher Education; Regional Student Participation and
Migration 2017).
4. Education pathways that address existing and emerging workforce needs,
customised for regional communities. The pathways should have a focus on
digital ability, critical thinking and entrepreneurship and critically, expose
students to industry and vice versa.
5. Incentives for earlier and deeper collaboration between both the schools and
VET sectors, and the Higher Education sector. This would include more
opportunities for schools and VET students (and key influencers such as
parents) to engage with their local education providers both within the school,
VET campus and on Higher Education campuses.
6. More coordination around pathway promotions within schools, between
Higher Education and Vocational education providers, with the intent of
reducing duplication and triplication activities (and to ensure that no school
misses out).
7. A continuing focus on the professional development of community and
industry leaders within regional Australia, alongside and in collaboration with
educational leaders. This professional development should focus on building
an advanced capability for collaboration in complex and changing
environments, managing ambiguity and stakeholder engagement.
8. A core requirement, for digital ability and capacity be raised. Digital inclusion
research indicates that regional Australians are 20 per cent less likely to use
online technologies to manage their work and personal lives than the national
average (Roy Morgan, Measuring Australia’s Digital Divide: The Australian
Digital Inclusion Index 2016). With technological impacts cited as one of five
disruptive megatrends for the next 10 years by Price Waterhouse Coopers
(PWC: what is a megatrend and why do they matter?), a dedicated focus will
help to bridge this gap.
9. A broader definition of information and communications technology (ICT)
investment within education sectors. While Professor Halsey’s Discussion
Paper touches on the need for innovation in the use of ICT (Pages 33 & 34), it
does not address regional disparities associated with community ability in the
use of ICT. Specific investment is required to ensure that once technologies
are accessible, teachers and educational leaders can make the best use of this
technology. This would include investment in best practice use of
videoconferencing and collaboration between networks of connected
education providers.
10. A continued focus on providing opportunities for students to access
education and training in the regional areas that they reside. Students who
study in regional areas tend to remain in regional areas after graduation and
provide a ready supply of professionals to fill critical regional roles (Acer:

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 23 of 40

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

Credit based pathway in tertiary education).

2.6

Innovative approaches that support regional, rural and remote students to
succeed in school and in their transition to further study, training and
employment
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:


that the Aspiration and Outreach agenda be continued;



that university school zones for partnership activity between universities be
established to allow for greater collaboration between institutions;



ongoing targeted support tailored to address access, participation and
success issues faced by Indigenous peoples who reside in regional, rural
and remote areas; and,



strategies to enhance Indigenous participation should be designed in
conjunction with local communities and embrace a whole of university
approach.

Furthermore, in this respect, Charles Sturt University recommends ongoing
targeted support tailored to address access, participation and success issues
faced by Indigenous peoples who reside in regional, rural and remote areas.
We also recommend that strategies used should be designed in conjunction
with local communities and embrace a whole of university approach. That is,
success in this area will not be enhanced by central, standardised approaches.
For example, Charles Sturt University’s Strong Moves mentoring program,
links to Future Moves and to the Indigenous Student Centres at the University.
This mentoring program was built in consultation with parents and students
from our local communities and provides a seamless relationship for school
students with staff and students in the University.
2.7

Charles Sturt University - Learnings from regional New South Wales and
Victoria and potential intervention strategies to boost regional, rural and
remote educational outcomes.
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:


that the Aspiration and Outreach agenda be continued;



the proposed budget reforms that remove enabling funding to be rejected;



that consideration is given to the need for additional strategies to
effectively support and engage regional rural and remote students who
study by distance education; and,



that three-year funding streams for outreach funding are established.

Furthermore, Charles Sturt University supports a minimum three-year HEPPP
funding stream to encourage schools’ continued partnerships and
CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY

Submission 122

participation, as per the August 2017 EPHEA statement:
This three-year funding stream would mean that equity practitioners can
coordinate widening participation and retention programs, resources
and partnerships more effectively and sustainably.
(EPHEA 2017, Information to Government Representatives regarding the
Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment [A More Sustainable,
Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System] Bill 2017.)
We also recommend that the Independent Review into Regional Rural and
Remote Education examine the early research findings from work currently
underway, including that of Charles Sturt University. In particular, we
recommend that the Review consult face-to-face with the pilot schools and
communities and drive a partnership with the University to progress the pilot
and research enquiry.
Finally, we recommend that the Review team consider the early trends
emerging from this research and partner with Charles Sturt University for
further development of the model.

Reforms to Modernise Australia’s Visa System
Australian Government - Department of Immigration and Border Protection
15 September 2017
1.

Recommendations
Charles Sturt University recommends the following reforms to modernise Australia’s
visa system:

1.1

Policy Consultation Paper - Visa Simplification: Transforming Australia’s Visa
System
(1)

Scope for reduction in the number of visas from 99 at present, to
approximately ten visas
Charles Sturt University recommends that:

(2)



all changes to the visa system are announced with adequate time to
prepare and educate the market with clarity around the policy settings
of changes to the visa system;



changes to the visa system reduce processing times and ensure
consistency in outcomes;



any changes to the visa system are made with recognition to the
differing characteristics of applicants in Australia’s diverse education
system;



the retention of a class of visa that support post study work
opportunities for graduates of Australian universities; and,



that the government should maintain short term visa pathways (such
as the current 600, 601, 651 and 400) that allow for overseas
academics and specialists to enter Australia for short periods of time
to undertake highly specialised activities and attend academic
meetings.

Delineation between temporary entry and long-term or permanent residence
Charles Sturt University recommends the retention of a class of visa that
support post study work opportunities for graduates of Australian universities.

(3)

Role a period of provisional residence could play in enhancing the integrity of
the visa system and easing the burden on taxpayers
Charles Sturt University recommends:


retention of a class of visa that support post study work opportunities
for graduates of Australian universities;

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 26 of 40

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

(4)



recognising time spent studying in Australia as part of any time
threshold in considering eligibility for permanent residency; and,



a period of provisional residence could indeed assist the
enhancement of the integrity of the visa system by securing our
investment and retaining our best people. This could be achieved by
individuals remaining with their sponsoring institution or their
nominated occupation for a defined period. However, the
implementation of provisional residence as the only pathway for
permanent residency could also be a hindrance for our sector and a
flexible approach is necessary in order to:


not limit the ability of academics to apply for competitive
Category 1 funding;



provide settlement opportunities (for example, ability to secure
mortgages); and,



ensure the reduction in exposure to additional costs of living,
such as;
o

state-based fees for public schooling; and

o

health care costs.

Ensuring that our visa system supports Australia as a competitive and
attractive destination for temporary and longer-term entrants
Charles Sturt University recommends:

(5)



that all changes to the visa system are announced with adequate time
to prepare and educate the market with clarity around the policy
settings of changes to the visa system;



that changes to the visa system reduce processing times and ensure
consistency in outcomes;



that the financial support threshold or application fees are not
increased against key competitor markets;



the retention of a class of visa that support post study work
opportunities for graduates of Australian Universities;



no change to existing framework for dependents and other family
members extended to student visa holders; and,



consideration of increases to - the number of student visas for
students who elect to study in a non-metropolitan location.

Simplifying our visa arrangements

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 27 of 40

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122

(a)

What would a system with approximately 10 visas look like?
Charles Sturt University recommends that:

(6)



any changes to the visa system are made with recognition to
the differing characteristics of applicants in Australia’s diverse
education system;



all changes to the visa system are announced with adequate
time to prepare and educate the market with clarity around the
policy settings of changes to the visa system;



changes to the visa system reduce processing times and
ensure consistency in outcomes; and,



the financial support threshold or application fees are not
increased against key competitor markets.

What factors should we consider when simplifying the visa system?
Charles Sturt University recommends that:


assessing visa applications are supported by clear, standardised and
objective criteria,



consideration be given to administrative processes that increase
efficiencies delivering savings in time processing and consistency of
outcomes,



all changes to the visa system are announced with adequate time to
prepare and educate the market with clarity around the policy settings
of changes to the visa system; and,



the financial support threshold or application fees are not increased
against key competitor markets.

Charles Sturt University also refers the Department, to the University’s recent
submission to the Inquiry into Regional Development and Decentralisation
which is currently being undertaken by the Select Committee of Regional
Development and Decentralisation of the House of Representatives of the
Australian Parliament, which contains a range of recommendations regarding
international students studying in regional Australia.
(7)

What should be the key characteristics of a simplified and flexible visa
system?
Charles Sturt University recommends that:


assessing visa applications are supported by clear, standardised and
objective criteria; and,

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 28 of 40

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122



(8)

consideration be given to administrative processes that increase
efficiencies delivering savings in time processing and consistency of
outcomes.

Temporary and permanent residence
(a)

What distinctions should apply to temporary and permanent visas?

Charles Sturt University recommends:

(b)



the retention of a class of visa that support post study work
opportunities for graduates of Australian universities;



considering increasing the number of student visas for
students who elect to study in a non-metropolitan location;



recognising time spent studying in Australia as part of any
time threshold in considering eligibility for permanent
residency; and,



recognising time spent studying in regional Australia as part of
any time threshold in considering eligibility for permanent
residency.

What requirements should underpin a migrant’s eligibility for
permanent residence?
Charles Sturt University recommends:

(c)



recognising time spent studying in Australia as part of any time
threshold in considering eligibility for permanent residency;
and,



recognising time spent studying in regional Australia as part of
any time threshold in considering eligibility for permanent
residency.

Should a prospective migrant spend a period of time in Australia
before becoming eligible for permanent residence? What factors
should be considered?
Charles Sturt University recommends:


recognising time spent studying in Australia as part of any time
threshold in considering eligibility for permanent residency;



recognising time spent studying in regional Australia as part of
any time threshold in considering eligibility for permanent
residency; and,

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY
Page 29 of 40

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 122



(9)

providing consideration to the provision of an extended poststudy work rights are lengthened should employment in
regional areas be prioritised by the applicants who find
employment in regional areas of Australia.

Modernising Australia’s visa arrangements
(a)

What role does the visa system play in ensuring Australia remains
attractive to the best and brightest temporary and permanent
migrants?
Charles Sturt University recommends:

(b)



that all changes to the visa system are announced with
adequate time to prepare and educate the market with clarity
around the policy settings of changes to the visa system;



that consideration be given to administrative processes that
increase efficiencies delivering savings in time processing and
consistency in outcomes;



that changes to the visa system are made with reference to the
settings imposed by key international education competitor
markets; and,



the retention of a class of visa that support post study work
opportunities for graduates of Australian Universities.

Inquiry on the Impact of Technological and Other Change on the Future of Work and
Workers in Australia
Select Committee on the Future of Work and Workers
20 February 2018
1.

Recommendations
Charles Sturt University recommends the following with regard the future of work and
future workforce capabilities:

1.1

The Future Nature of Work
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:
That:







1.2

Technology literacy will be crucial to maximise participation in
workforce of the future.
Future workforce productivity will depend on individual talent that is
creative, innovative, entrepreneurial and resilient.
Individuals, as well as education and training providers, must be
incentivised to undertake and provide science, technology, arts,
engineering and maths (STEAM) studies, as well as globally-focused
commercial studies, particularly international markets and finance.
Australia must aim to exceed the OECD average for public R&D
expenditure in support of the recommendations above.
Building on initiatives, such as the National Science and Innovation
Agenda (NISA), see http://www.innovation.gov.au and the Prosperity
Through Innovation Statement of January 2018, see
https://industry.gov.au/Innovation-and-ScienceAustralia/Pages/default.aspx, Australian governments must adopt a
national technology transformation agenda, much like the leadership
shown by the Victorian Government in the 1990s with regards
multimedia.

Impact of the Changing Nature of Work
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:
That building on the recommendations put forward above, governments and
the private sector will not only have to continue but increase investment in
technology infrastructure, as “nice-to-have” infrastructure becomes “criticalutility” for future economic and social development, for example broadband
connectivity being the railway line of the 21st Century.

1.3

Wide Effect of the Changing Nature of Work on the Economy, Society and the
Environment
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY

Submission 122

That, building on University Australia’s 2010 work regarding Australia’s future
academic workforce,
https://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/news/commissionedstudies/Academic-Workforce#.WnOZnkxuJjo, that the Australian Government,
through COAG develop and implement, with the tertiary education and training
sector, a national strategy for ensuring Australia maintains and assembles a
technology-orientated academic workforce through the 21st Century.
1.4

Adequacy of Legislative Frameworks for the Future Nature of Work
That the Australian Government, work with industry, unions and the tertiary
education and training sector to undertake a review of, develop and implement
findings, of the Fair Work Act 2009 and related legislative instruments to
ensure that Australia’s industrial relations system is 21st Century technology
fit-for-purpose to ensure international competitiveness for the future of work.

1.5

International Efforts – Capturing the Opportunities and Meeting the Challenges
of the Future Workforce
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:
That the Commonwealth Government commission suitable service providers to
undertake a comprehensive review of international efforts aimed at capturing
the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the future nature of work, with
the report providing the basis for stakeholder consultation regarding the future
of work and the nation’s workforce.

1.6

Other Future Work and Workforce Considerations – In Regional, Rural and
Remote Communities
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations:
That the recommendations detailed above regarding the future of work and the
future workforce be developed and implemented with specific consideration
given to the specific circumstances and unique needs of regional cities, rural
towns and remote communities across Australia.

Advice on the Impacts of Professional Accreditation in Higher Education
The Higher Education Standards Panel
30 April 2018
1.

Recommendations
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations regarding the Higher
Education Standards Panel’s (the Panel) advice on the impact of professional
accreditation in Australian higher education and opportunities to reduce the
regulatory burden on higher education providers:

1.1

Assessment for Accreditation of Professional Competencies
Charles Sturt University recommends that the findings of the Higher Education
Standards Panel’s regarding the accreditation assessment of professional
competencies by professional associations as set out in The Higher Education
Standards Panel’s Advice on the Impacts of Professional Accreditation in
Higher Education, be accepted by the Government and be implemented in full.

1.2

Professional Associations - Accreditation Capability & Capacity
Charles Sturt University recommends that the findings of the Higher Education
Standards Panel’s regarding the capability and capacity of professional
associations to accredit university graduates and tomorrow’s future workforce
as set out in The Higher Education Standards Panel’s Advice on the Impacts of
Professional Accreditation in Higher Education, be accepted by the
Government and be implemented in full, subject to the Commonwealth
ensuring that the:

1.3



policies, procedures and systems of accrediting organisations be
simplified, streamlined and aligned wherever possible, particularly at
the course level, but also at the disciple and industry level too;



enhanced management, administration and reporting mechanisms
proposed by the Panel do not incur additional costs for higher
education providers; and,



common, technology platform solution only be implemented if the
Government is prepared to provide sufficient funding to ensure such a
solutions success – both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

Stakeholder Engagement – Education Providers & Professional Associations
Charles Sturt University recommends that the findings of the Higher Education
Standards Panel’s regarding the Government’s forward stakeholder
engagement with education providers and professional associations to ensure
the most efficient and effective professional accreditation system possible in
Australia for tomorrow’s future workforce as set out in The Higher Education
Standards Panel’s Advice on the Impacts of Professional Accreditation in

Higher Education, be accepted by the Government and be not only
implemented in full but be strengthened to ensure as close as possible to align
policy, streamline process and integrate system for accreditation efficiency
and effectiveness.
1.4

Observations from Regional Australia - Professional Accreditation
Charles Sturt University recommends that particular attention be given to
research, findings, analysis and recommendations regarding professional
accreditation in regional Australia, to ensure the regional higher education
providers can efficiently and effectively work with professional accreditation
organisations to ensure that Australia’s regional cities, rural towns and remote
communities have access to the professional workforce required today and
into the future to ensure the prosperity of non-metropolitan Australians.

Closing the Gap – the Next Phase
Australian Government
30 April 2018
1.

Recommendations
Charles Sturt University makes the following recommendations regarding future
Closing the Gap reforms, policies, initiatives and programs:
1.1

Recognising the Value of Tertiary Education & Training
Charles Sturt University recommends that:
i. the value of tertiary education and training be recognised in the
ongoing Closing the Gap agenda, not just for school leavers and
young adults, but all First Nations people including Elders.
ii. all education programs are designed to enable all First Nations
students to engage in their own education in ways that enable
them to achieve the successful outcomes they desire from the
learning experience. Life experience, closely aligned with
language and culture, is a strong determinant in what students
want to learn and how they wish to pursue the necessary
learning experiences.
iii. real progress to close the gap through tertiary education and
training will depend on all Australians, Indigenous and nonIndigenous working together to effect change, adoption of
enhanced reporting mechanisms, measuring actual performance
with meaningful and tangible indicators, valuing culture and
custom in study and agreeing targets for responsibility of
management and accountability of governance.
iv. unlocking the value of tertiary education and training will require:







equality of study outcome, not just equity in participation;
learner support to ensure capacity for moving forward and
better futures;
greater reach, depth and presence in remote Australia,
including recognising the role of digital technology and
face-to-face study hubs, but that the logistical and
financial challenges associated with connectivity in
remote communities and locations must be overcome;
de-alienisation of learning spaces, including actions to
overcome sheer loneliness and inability to engage; and,
continual improvement and investment in pathways from
school to tertiary education and training, as well as for
adults (without accredited qualifications or who have
disengaged from formal education) to access vocational
education and training as well as higher education.

1.2

Enabling People to Work Effectively Together
Charles Sturt University recommends that real progress to close the gap
through tertiary education and training will depend on all Australians,
Indigenous and non-Indigenous working together to effect change,
including through:










1.3

commitment to a process of genuine and meaningful engagement
that reduces and, in the future eliminates systemically and
structurally racist ideas and beliefs;
acceptance and recognition, including constitutionally, legally
through treaty and truth commission;
authentic collaborative conversations that enable Indigenous and
non-Indigenous Australians to work together for a better future;
address feelings of inadequacy through recognition of the
genuine challenges of learning in remote communities, and being
from a remote community;
building and maintaining relationships with communities to
support greater involvement in learning needs;
cultural competency training and education for institutional staff
(and students);
draw on educators and trainers with learned-experiences;
inclusion of these themes in curriculum, for both Indigenous and
non-Indigenous students; and,
above all else, in concert with key stakeholders provide a
welcoming environment in which to learn.

Enhancing Reporting
Charles Sturt University recommends that real progress to close the gap
through tertiary education and training will depend on adoption of
enhanced reporting mechanisms, including through reporting
processes that:








are informative and transparent;
allow for Indigenous Australian’s to be respected and have their
say about what matters to them, and what is important to report
on;
are collaborative in nature, with Indigenous ownership;
are genuinely consultative and outcomes focused (rather than
“tick-the-box” bureaucracy);
draw on feedback and really focus on need for change;
manage and report quality and risk of reconciliation through
continual improvement and a constant quest for Elder input and
knowledge; and,
inclusion of non-Indigenous students and staff of education and
training institutions in equity and equality and the interplay
between all cultures.

1.4

Using More Effective & Meaningful Performance Indicators
Charles Sturt University recommends that real progress to close the gap
through tertiary education and training will depend on measuring actual
performance with meaningful and tangible indicators, including through:










1.5

development of an agreed definition of what closing the gap in
education means, what it is expected to deliver and how success
will be measured (beyond NAPLAN, Year 12 completion etc.);
metrics for education and training institutions commitment to
First Nations;
ensuring non-Indigenous Australians learning about First
Nations’ culture, custom, people and communities, at the
regional and local level, again with metrics for progress
metrics must take into account that not all Indigenous people,
their Nations and their cultures are the same;
customised and targeted education and training performance
measurement that is culturally inclusive and linguistically
appropriate (learning from the poor integration of NAPLAN
questions with Indigenous and remote community cultures);
consistent with 1.2 and 1.3 above, metrics should be developed
and refined by listening to Indigenous Australians to ensure
outcomes are tangible and real (and genuinely understanding
need to close the gap); and,
recognising that effective and meaningful key performance
indicators are crucial to close gaps – as, what gets measured
gets done.

Enabling People to Understand & Value Their Differences
Charles Sturt University recommends that real progress to close the gap
through tertiary education and training will depend on all Australians,
Indigenous and non-Indigenous valuing culture and custom in study,
including through:








education journeys that are grounded within First People’s own
cultures and languages;
providing a sense of belonging that ensures that Indigenous
students become critically engaged in the learning process;
recognising that reconciliation is more than a legal definition of
title, but is more about connection to country, and the nation’s
history, knowledge, language, culture and stories;
strategies to combat disadvantage and promote positive futures
embedded in teaching and learning plans;
revitalising language as a solution for inclusivity, including
education and training delivery in First Nation languages and
teaching of First Nation languages to non-Indigenous
Australians, particularly at the regional level;
not only empowering students, but also enabling a quality of
learning engagement that is equally satisfying for the teacher and
fellow learners;

striving to ensure that the world in which we live is one that
values us as human beings who are valued for our ‘common
humanity’, ie. we measure our worth by the way we are treated by
others; and,
as the basis for enabling people to understand and value their
differences adopt a both ways education model for future
teaching, learning and research in primary, secondary and
tertiary education.

Enabling People to Commit to Targets for Responsibility &
Accountability
Charles Sturt University recommends that real progress to close the gap
through tertiary education and training will depend on all Australians,
Indigenous and non-Indigenous agreeing targets for responsibility of
management and accountability of governance, including through:



traditional knowledge, shared understanding and be evidencebased, or at the very least, be embedded in research that will
provide a future empirical evidence base; and,
performance management descriptors that promote, encourage
and reward closing the gap initiatives in education and training,
at the organisational, contractual (in the case of service delivery
agreements) and personnel level, including, but not limited to the
following higher education commitments and targets for
responsibility and accountability:
a. further development of cultural competency frameworks
which clearly map targets for responsibility and
accountability across training organisations and
education providers;
b. further formal research into decolonising and
indigenising measures;
c. development of research that identifies and focusses on
the aspirations of local Indigenous communities within the
sphere of across training organisation and education
provider influence;
d. developing innovative and engaging online training
courses in cultural competency for all staff throughout
their term of employment. Where possible, modules will
be developed, and face-to-face delivery will be undertaken
by qualified Indigenous staff;
e. the review of all hybrid subjects to ensure cultural
competency is achieved across training organisations and
education providers and the tertiary education system
(possibly through ASQA and TEQSA);

CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY

f.

the Indigenous schools of training organisations and
tertiary education providers will undertake communitybased research to build and maintain relationships
between all education and training providers including,
the secondary school system, and industry or local
businesses; and,

g. student participation and retention in Indigenous
knowledge and cultural subjects to be measured through
internal analytics generated from enrolments, face to face
and online student activity across training organisations
and education providers.
