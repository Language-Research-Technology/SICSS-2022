Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 96

Executive Summary
This submission provides a snapshot of indicators and impact of inequality in Tasmania. Using data and
surveys from one of the more regional parts of our state – the North/North West – we demonstrate the
many dimensions of life that are affected by regional disadvantage, in particular: income, housing,
employment, education, transport, health and digital inclusion.
Our submission not only provides evidence of large inequalities between regional Tasmania and nonregional areas of the State and the rest of the country, it also points to some of the drivers of this
inequality. While some of these drivers are beyond the control of a single government to address,
particularly those regarding technological change, this submission highlights opportunities for policy
intervention at state and federal level that would help address many of the inequalities currently being
experienced by Australians who live in regional areas. Given that just over a third of the population lives
in these areas, addressing this inequality should be a matter of urgent national attention.

Key policy challenges

Boosting the education and skills of people in regional Australia won’t be enough. Without the
right jobs, those with more education and higher skills will simply seek work elsewhere – most
likely in Australia’s larger cities.
Technological advances, particularly in communications, are not a cure-all for regional Australia.
Governments need to ensure that regional Australians have meaningful access and
opportunities to take advantage of new technologies. Governments also need to be conscious of
the unintended effects technology brings to regional areas, particularly on employment
opportunities and the impact of the withdrawal of face-to-face service delivery.
Regional Australia needs better access to health and other services.
Better and more affordable access to transport in regional areas, whether public or private,
would assist low-income Australians, in particular, to take advantage of educational and
employment opportunities.
Housing affordability is as much of an issue in regional areas as it is in parts of Australia where
housing costs receive more attention. That is because of the close connection in regional areas
between housing, income poverty and lack of access to services and employment opportunities.
For a range of reasons, poverty is exacerbated in regional areas. Increasing income support
payments are one key to overcoming regional inequality in Australia.

Introduction
TasCOSS welcomes the opportunity to provide input into the Senate Standing Committee on Economics
Inquiry into Regional Inequality in Australia.
Regional inequality manifests in a myriad of ways. Compared to their city counterparts, people living in
regional Australia experience poorer health outcomes, have lower levels of educational attainment,

earn lower incomes and are not enjoying the same benefits of technological advances. With over a third
of Australians living in regional areas, these poorer outcomes can not be due to individual failings; it is
clear that there are larger forces at work preventing equality in outcomes between regional and
metropolitan Australians.
This submission provides a snapshot of the diverging fortunes of regional and metropolitan Australia
through the lens of one of the more regional parts of Tasmania, the North/North West. We see that the
greater Burnie area has poor outcomes across a range of indicators – education, digital inclusion, access
to services, transport and housing and health. These indicators are influenced by the ‘capitals
framework’ adopted by the Productivity Commission in its 2017 report, Transitioning Regional
Economies.i What they demonstrate is that, what might at first appear to be a story about the economic
underperformance of regional areas, is as much if not more of a story about the human toll of
government underinvestment in essential services and human opportunity. The invitation is to level the
playing field.
The data we use in this submission is drawn from a variety of sources. Two reports, in particular, capture
the story told by this submission. The first, at Attachment 1, is Voices of Our Region: North West and
West Tasmania. Through data and interviews, this TasCOSS report highlights the extent of disadvantage
in relation to the rest of Tasmania. The second report, at Attachment 2, is the 2017 Tasmania Report,
which uses economic and social indicators to paint an often bleak picture of disadvantage relative to the
rest of the country - but in doing so also points clearly to what needs to be done.

Drivers and impact of regional inequality
Education
Education and skills are often described as ‘human capital’ in the economic literature. People learn new
skills through formal learning—schooling, apprenticeships and vocational qualifications, and
university—and informal learning gained on-the-job and from family, friends, and peers. Education and
skills are key factors undergirding regional economic health, and Tasmania’s regional centres are almost
invariably disadvantaged in this domain.ii
Education and skills are about more than economic growth or decline. Low economic and social
opportunity are closely connected to poor health outcomes, and the protective effect of education
(especially early education) and good employment on health and wellbeing is critically important.iii

Submission 96

Securing higher levels of education in regional areas is only part of the answer, though. That is because
people with higher levels of education and skills tend to move to areas with more and better
employment opportunities. Graduates of Australian regional university campuses are very mobile, and
the big cities are the beneficiaries: 62% of graduates from ‘inner regional’ campuses relocate to major
cities, according to one 2010 study, alongside 39% of graduates from ‘outer regional’ areas.iv The
overwhelming motivation of graduates who move is for employment (and employment appropriate for
their newly-acquired skills), with this factor outweighing the lifestyle benefits of country living.vvi
Tasmanian research has also found that a lack of suitable jobs is driving people out of Tasmania.vii
Unemployment is our biggest challenge.
Young people’s expectations of work have changed, they need to move to where the work is.viii
The graphs below show that the age patterns of migration for Burnie and for Melbourne are almost
mirror-images: Burnie exports its young, while Melbourne sees an outflow of people approaching
retirement age (who are not constrained by the availability of jobs).ix This reflects the geography of
employment in Australia: young people are moving for work.

Technological change and digital inclusion
Telecommunications technology has been touted as a lifeline for regional Australia because of the
potential for work to be conducted remotely, service centres to be relocated from cities to regional
areas and the growth of new forms of work that are driven by or take advantage of technological
developments. The evidence, however, suggests that technological advances have helped cities more
than regions in Australia.
One reason for this is that people still seem to prefer face-to-face interactions, at least for the provision
of certain services.x Another reason is that tech-intensive industries tend to concentrate in urban areas,
which means technology is changing business location decisions but in favour of large cities.xi A third
reason is that new communications technologies are resulting in job losses from regional communities.
Branches of the big banks have been shuttered across Tasmania, including in New Norfolk, Westbury,
Longford, Cygnet, Bicheno, Bridport, Somerset, and Westbury.xii Or to take the example of wholesale
trade, jobs in this sector declined by 34% in Tasmania between 2006 and 2016, or by about 2500
positions; that drop was sharper in Tasmania than any other state or territory.xiii There are many other
examples, such as the disappearance of video rental stores due to online streaming.

Centralisation of Government employment and minimal funding for local services [is a problem].
North West is becoming like a "ghost town".xiv
Beyond jobs, technological change can bring social exclusion. Government and commercial services—
banking, as mentioned above, but also Centrelink and Medicare claims—are increasingly provided
online, with an expectation of digital access and ability. But we know Australia’s regions—and especially
Tasmania—are not as digitally included, and our regional populations not as able with technology as
their metropolitan cousins. Even within Tasmania, the gap between the digital inclusion of cities and
country is widening.xv Of all the states or territories, people in Tasmania are the least likely to access
government services online.xvi
As the Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII) demonstrates, another issue is digital ability. While the
ADII is only one indicator of community well-being, it reinforces what is already well-known –the
benefits of new technologies are not shared equally, and people living in poverty can have their
disadvantage further entrenched by digital exclusion.
A SACOSS 2016 report into connectivity costs shows that 62% of the (low income) respondents surveyed
reported experiencing difficulty paying for, or having to cut back or stop using, one or more
telecommunications services for financial reasons in the last 12 months.xvii In the same year, the
Salvation Army’s Out of Reach report demonstrated that 58% of surveyed households with children
could not afford an internet connection at home and 74% did not have a computer, tablet or iPad.xviii
While it may be assumed that young people are ‘digital natives’, these data show that some children
and young people lack adequate access to the internet and digital technology platforms. There is clearly
a risk that over time, this initial disadvantage will be amplified in education and the labour market.
The potential benefits of digital inclusion and risks of exclusion related to poverty are particularly
significant in Tasmania, because 31.3% of Tasmania’s population are in the most disadvantaged
socioeconomic status quintile (one-fifth) of Australia’s population, a higher proportion than for any
other State or Territory.xix The latest ADII report shows that Tasmania remains Australia’s least digitally
included state and that the gap between Tasmania and other jurisdictions is increasing.xx
Some groups in Tasmania experience particularly high levels of digital exclusion, shown by ADII scores
substantially below the state average (49.7). These are people in low income households (40.5), older
Australians (41.0), people who did not complete secondary school (42.7), and people not in paid
employment (45.8).
Without remedial action, Tasmania will be left further behind. A whole of community approach to digital
inclusion will enable Tasmania to derive much needed benefit from the digital economy.

Access to services and health
Technology will also have an impact on inequality in access to health services. An increase in Medicarefunded ‘telehealth’ consultations (video-conferencing) could have a similar exclusionary effect as the
withdrawal of banking and other services in Australia’s regional areas. As more demand moves to
telehealth, the local provision of GP services may become unsustainable.xxi
The need for provision of health care in regional Australia will grow, with people living longer and the
increasing burden of chronic disease. In the Burnie region, the median age at death is 76 compared to
82 in Greater Melbourne.xxii In less connected Tasmanian communities outcomes are far worse, with the
median age at death on Tasmania’s West Coast or in the Central Highlands an astonishing 72—ten years
fewer of life than in greater Melbourne. Rates of death from avoidable causes on Tasmania’s isolated
West Coast is 2.3x that of Greater Melbourne.xxiii
Dental services are a particularly acute need in regional Australia. Though the West Coast of Tasmania
does have visiting children’s dental services, adult dental care is not provided in either the public or
private sectors, with the closest clinic some two hours’ drive away in Burnie. Tasmanians have the worst
dental health in the nation.xxiv

Transport and housing
Many regional and rural areas of Australia are car-dependent. Over 90% of workers in the Burnie region
travel to work by car, motorcycle, or truck as a passenger or driver.xxv While many people in Australia’s
large cities choose to use a private vehicle to travel to work, regional and rural areas are disadvantaged
because there is often no real alternative to relying on a private vehicle. Social research connects
transport with social and economic isolation, and notes that young people, women, unemployed
people, Indigenous Australians, older people, people with disability, people on low incomes and sole
parents are most vulnerable to transport disadvantage. Enforced car dependence makes the cost of
purchasing and running a car involuntary, and this becomes an additional financial stress on low-income
families and individuals. And for people without the means to run a private car, social and economic
isolation is the inevitable result. xxvi
Public transport is limited, there is some public transport around town. There are no buses on Sunday.
The public transport between towns is very expensive. You are stuck in Burnie and can’t afford to get
out.xxvii
Transport disadvantage is closely connected to housing disadvantage: with inner city or urban areas
becoming increasingly unaffordable - whether to rent or to buy a house – more people are pushed
further away from areas that offer services, employment and access to public transport. This has a
number of flow-on effects, including making it harder for young people to access education.xxviii The

8

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 96

recent Independent Review into Regional, Rural, and Remote Education observed that the
unaffordability of student accommodation in the major cities for young people on Youth Allowance
closes off educational opportunities for students from regional Australia, who cannot remain in their
parental home while they study.xxix
Housing in regional areas can often be less expensive than in urban areas. As the Voices of Our Regions
report shows, however, this is not always the case, partly because lower incomes in regional areas
means people can still be paying a large proportion of their income on housing costs. Lower housing
costs can also act as a perverse incentive to remain in areas with fewer employment opportunities,
because moving to an area with more opportunities would be unaffordable.
The difference in the prices of rents away from here are too high. We can’t relocate.xxx

Income
Slightly over a third of Australians live in regional areas.xxxi Poverty is slightly worse in rural, regional and
remote areas (14.1% ‘outside capital cities’) than in capital cities (12.8%). When housing costs (which
are higher in capital cities) are not taken into account, that divide becomes greater.xxxii
As this submission has shown, households living in poverty in regional and rural areas experience
additional pressures that exacerbate poverty such as fewer employment opportunities and reduced
access to health services, education and transport. Surveys conducted in Tasmania’s North and North
West found that, as a result of these inequalities, a higher proportion of people living in the region were
unable to raise $2000 within two days in case of emergency than the state average.xxxiii Every year 5000
households go without meals, 7000 can’t afford to heat their homes and over 21,000 struggle to pay
their bills on time.xxxiv
These surveys found that key spending pressures included: the price of private rentals; the cost of food,
utilities, and telecommunications; some also noted the impact of big occasional bills such as car
registration. Many said that they had accessed help from family, friends, emergency relief services and
their local Neighbourhood Houses. A number of participants appreciated financial literacy training and
initiatives that help people make their income go farther by bartering of goods and services.
Learning about how to save money and spend what we have well has really helped... There is
also a new program called CENTS, where you can trade skills or things that other people might
want to buy. This is a great idea, as it doesn’t affect Centrelink.xxxv
Increasing income support payments would go a long way to addressing poverty in regional and rural
areas. Voices from across the community and private sectors are calling for an increase in core working
age payments, including ACOSS, the Business Council of Australia, KPMG, and Deloitte.xxxvi An expanded

and sufficient safety net would address both regional inequality and core economic inequality in
Australia. This need will only become more urgent as the geography of opportunity in Australia
continues to change.

Conclusion
Regional Australia is not in an inevitable decline, just as current levels of regional inequality have not
been inevitable but the result of a succession of policy choices. But to change, we need to invest
differently – in communities and people, in the same way we invest in national infrastructure, in
research and development and in projects of state significance. In regional Australia in particular, our
people are our greatest resource and without them, regional Australia will wither and die. TasCOSS
encourages the Committee to use this submission to recommend greater investment in the people of
regional Australia, and in the communities in which they live and have a right to thrive.
