Introduction
Inequality in Australia is high and growing. Recent analysis has shown that the top 1% of people
have increased their share of the nation’s wealth to 23%, owning more than the bottom 70% of
Australians. In our wealthiest areas, such as Point Piper, the global elite live in property more
expensive than the most prestigious addresses in Saint-Tropez or Moscow, earning an average of
close to $200,000 per year. In contrast residents of Bulyeroi and Rowena in far-northeast NSW
earned an average of just $12,004. Our current growth in income inequality is among the highest
in the world according to the IMF.1
Unemployment has diverged widely across the country. In our once thriving manufacturing centres,
the chance to gain fulfilling employment has been massively reduced. In the Adelaide suburb of
Elizabeth, previously home to Holden manufacturing, nearly 1/3 of the workforce is unable to find
work. Youth unemployment has increased to over 13% nationally but is as high as 67% in Outback
Queensland.2
Inequality of income and employment is also strongly correlated with other forms for inequality: In
our poorest communities such as Central NT, life expectancy is a full decade less than the national
average3, and Indigenous communities are subjected to the arbitrary and punitive Community
Development Programme. Regional inequality encompasses a complex and multifaceted set of
issues. While recognising many other symptoms, causes and consequences of regional inequality,
this submission will focus on the areas of:

1. The shifting locations of work
Traditional perceptions of Australia and Australian life focus on the outback, beaches and the small
regional town. This was, at one point in time, true. In 1901, one in three Australian workers was
employed in agriculture, forestry, fishery or mining.4 In 1906, 50% of Australia’s population lived
on rural properties or in a small town of fewer than 3000 people.5 By 1966, this had already
changed dramatically - 3 in 5 Australians then lived in a city with a population greater than 100,000
and by 2008, 2 in 3 Australians lived in a capital city.6 According to the ABS, the figure has
remained fairly steady since the late 1970s.7

What has continued to occur is the steady shift of productive work to the cities and away from rural
and regional areas. Agriculture and manufacturing, two industries that drove the economy in the
20th century, both required the cheap and abundant land that regional and sub-urban areas
offered. The decline of these industries, as discussed earlier, has seen a steady shift towards the
city as the dominant economic force in Australia. As Figure 1 shows, 80% of economic activity in
2011-12 occurred in or near our major cities, with the remaining 20% occurring in every other part

of Australia.8 As can be seen, this activity was particular concentrated around the large cities on
the east coast and in Perth. Despite the mining boom, at its height in 2011, very few regional areas
are included in the 80% proportion. The five largest cities in Australia make up, in each case, the
majority of their state’s economy. Sydney is 73% of NSW, Melbourne 81% of Victoria and Adelaide
is 79% of South Australia. Perth and Brisbane are less dominant, but still make up 64% and 52%
of their states respectively.9
This has come about in large part due to the rise in the service economy. In both Sydney and
Melbourne, chosen for present purposes as the two most populous cities in Australia, the central
business district provides the vast majority of economic activity, despite representing a tiny fraction
of the land area and population of the city. Figure (2) shows maps of each city, highlighting the
significance of the CBD for the city’s economy.10

Service industries tend to be more labour intensive than other types; they don’t require significant
amounts of land or capital intense machinery and many, such as retail and food/accommodation,
benefit greatly from concentrated populations. High-skilled service jobs have increased relative to
high-skill manufacturing which has concentrated investment and wealth into the centres of capital

cities. This has resulted in higher than average incomes in many inner suburbs, but also higher
inequality.
The service sector has substantially higher rates of underemployment, more part time work,
generally more insecure work and shorter average tenure.11 This is in part due to the lower rates
of unionisation which has a negative impact on the ability to bargain for more secure work and
higher pay.

2. Unemployment
Unemployment tends to be well above the national average in remote regions, particularly those
with high Indigenous populations. These locations include much of the Northern Territory, the
Kimberly in northern Western Australia, and outback central Western Australia (below the Pilbara
region). Areas of Far North Queensland – including Aurukun, Yarrabah, Palm Island, and
Kowanyama to Pormpuraaw – have extremely high unemployment rates: more than 40 per cent,
compared to the national average of 5.6%. There are also patches of high unemployment in
Gippsland in eastern Victoria and on the coast of NSW and southern Queensland.
Figure 5: unemployment rates

In our cities, areas of high unemployment are frequently concentrated in what were previously
manufacturing areas. Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) level data shows even more uneven
geographical disparities. Bankstown in NSW has averaged an unemployment rate of 11.9% since
the Coalition took power in 2013. Rockhampton City, Queensland, unemployment is at a
staggering 22.8% over the same period.

Manufacturing job losses
The geographical concentration of work in our state capitals and specifically their CBDs has come
about in part due to the deindustrialisation of the economy due to the global integration of the
economy. Similar outcomes have been experienced in many developed economies.

However, this process is far from passive and inevitable – it has come about through policy choices
and it produces significant consequences for inequality within cities and between cities and
regions. As figure 3 shows, the rapid decline in the value of our manufacturing sector is dramatic.
Most countries in the OECD have seen a decline in manufacturing over the period from 1980 to
the GFC, but for many the trend levelled out in 2008-9. Australia on the other hand has seen the
decline in manufacturing continue and shows no sign in abating. In fact, given the massive loss of
high value jobs in the automotive sector in 2016-17, this trend is likely to deepen for the 20172018 period.

The decline in manufacturing is often put forward as an inevitable consequence of being a
developed nation and that developing countries will become the new engines of manufacturing
due to low labour costs. However, this neo-liberal view is outdated and misses the reality that high
skilled manufacturing work in ship building, automotive, aerospace, robotics and high precision
machine manufacturing is still continuing in many developed nations. In the high labour cost
economies of Switzerland, Austria and Japan, manufacturing accounts for roughly 20% of value
added, compared to Australia’s 6%.

In terms of aerospace exports, only one developing country - Brazil - makes the top ten. When it
comes to car exports, Mexico is the only developing nation in the top tier. Maintaining or
abandoning manufacturing is in large part a political decision, and Australian politicians have taken
this trend to the extreme, reducing import tariffs and removing behind the border protections far
beyond other nations. The level of subsidies to key industries indicates how valuable other
countries consider their manufacturing to be. For example, the German Federal Government
provided $A17.2 billion in automotive subsidies over the ten years from 2007-17,12 the US
provided Boeing with US$13.4 billion over 15 years and the UK government is spending billions in
ensuring advanced manufacturing companies such as Rolls Royce remain viable.13
Australian politicians have chosen the easy path by relying on mineral and unprocessed
agricultural exports, rather than engage with developing our manufacturing sector. Where
investment schemes are in place, such as the Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive
program, serious concerns have been raised about big firms gaming the system for benefits rather
than invest.14 Despite PM Turnbull pumping billions into the innovation agenda, the start-up
industry body has described the Australian innovation agenda as “going backwards”. 15
Peak industries provide huge productivity spill-overs through R&D spending and the outsourcing
of problem solving to supply chain firms. Considering our large and successful engineering
research position in tertiary education,16 maintaining industries for the application of this
knowledge should be paramount. Innovations in manufacturing and product design such as Tesla
Cars, Dyson vacuum cleaners, Sony TVs and IKEA furniture all rely on domestic R&D and
manufacturing in their initial phases, and we should not allow ourselves to be cut out of the
opportunity to compete for high value goods.

Deindustrialisation and Regional Inequality
Many of our industrial towns and outer suburbs have been abandoned under the current lack of
planning and Industry policy. The Coalition Government’s abandonment of the car industry shows
the failures of their economic ambition and the consequences for localised unemployment. For
example, Broadmeadows in Melbourne’s north, once home to 600 Ford workers, and many more
in the supply chain, has an unemployment rate of 25.4%. Elizabeth, the home of Holden
manufacturing for nearly 100 years, now has nearly a third of the workforce unable to find work.
Elizabeth East and Port Adelaide both have unemployment levels of over 13%. Some estimates
put the number of job losses in Adelaide’s automotive components and manufacturing supply
chain at 50,000.17
Previous experience of closures has shown how long term the consequences are for job losses in
highly specialised industries such as car manufacturing. When Mitsubishi closed their Tonsley Park
site and exited Australia in 2008, roughly one third of full time workers found full time employment,
and the other two thirds found only part time or no work at all. It needs to be remembered that at
that time there were many other jobs for workers to take up at other automotive factories, meaning
that the consequences for former Holden and Ford workers will be far more severe now that the
industry has been closed.
Outer suburbs in the capital cities tend to have lower levels of income growth and tertiary
education, but very high population growth and more migrants. Migrants from Asia, Africa and the

Middle East are more likely to settle in these suburbs. The once ubiquitous Australian pathway
from poor migrant to prosperous middle class through manufacturing has effectively been cut off
– it is far more difficult to gain a high skill service job without native English language skills and
tertiary education, than it is to gain a manufacturing job and develop applied skills.

Fig 6: Underemployment is at a record high

Underemployment
Underemployment, the phenomenon of the underutilisation of the productive capacity of the
employed population, is a major issue for many Australians in work. Despite the Government’s
persistent claim that unemployment is low and job creation high, they consistently ignore
underemployment. Underemployment is closely related to the unemployment: both involve a
notion of insufficient hours of paid work; both are linked in official labour force statistics as aspects
of labour force underutilisation. The underutilisation rate is at the highest rate in decades for
certain groups, which may explain why wage growth is at such a low level.

Our rate of underemployment far outstrips the rest OECD average,18 with ANZ describing the
phenomenon as “widespread” throughout the country.19 While traditionally underemployment has
remained far below the unemployment rate, a shift has occurred around the turn of the century,
with underemployment remaining stubbornly high (figure 6). The OECD pointed out in 2010 that
“despite [Australia] having a lower than average unemployment rate, overall slack in the labour
market is actually higher than the OECD average” due to underemployment.20
Precarious work is increasingly becoming the norm which makes it more difficult for workers to
argue for fair pay and conditions. Underemployed workers are more likely to exhibit lower job
satisfaction, higher job turnover, poorer mental and physical health and persistently lower
income.21 These workers are often trapped in the rental market, unable to earn enough to enter
our spiralling housing market. It is especially problematic and far more hidden in the regions and
remote Australia.22 Women, people with a lower educational attainment and individuals living in
rural areas were found to be far more impacted by underemployment.23 worryingly research has

established that workers who experienced underemployment in a previous period are considerably
more likely to experience underemployment again.24
Recommendations
•
•

Increase bargaining power for workers to ensure they can effectively negotiate suitable
hours.
Provide adequate income support to the underemployed.

Regional youth unemployment
Over the past two years the above data shows that there has been on average a 5.3% increase in
youth unemployment in the 20 most hard-hit areas. In areas such as Shepparton in Victoria and
Southern Highlands, NSW, entry level workers are competing with working holiday maker visa
holders (WHM) for entry level positions. As was discussed above a lack of government oversight
enables a very high level of exploitation of WHM workers. Young local jobseekers simply cannot
compete on these terms. In our former industrial centres such as Bendigo and parts of Adelaide
and Melbourne, the decline in decent entry level manufacturing jobs is preventing young workers
from gaining work.

Youth underemployment is also increasing rapidly. The number of weekly hours underemployed
young workers wish to gain has risen from 1.8 to 3.1 in 2014.25
Apprenticeships and PaTH
The Government has reduced the budget for apprenticeships by one billion dollars, and TAFE
funding has dropped by 30% in the last decade. The 2016/17 Budget pulled $247 million from
skills training, limiting the routes for young working-class people to find meaningful well paid and
employment.
Young workers from these areas of high unemployment and underemployment are also frequently
victims of the Turnbull Government’s deeply troubling PaTH ‘internship’ program. Despite
significant community concern about the impact the program will have on vulnerable young job
seekers, the program offers up young people as free labour, displacing real, wage-paying jobs,
offering them no meaningful qualifications and handing money to employers.
For the same money that is being spent on PaTH, 120,000 young people could complete a
Certificate IV, a real qualification that leads to a real job. There are currently at least five job seekers
for every vacancy. Despite this, the Government has elected to place young people on the PaTH
Scheme who will work for a fraction of the wage of an actual worker. The ‘internships’ this program
creates replace real, entry level jobs that millions of Australians rely on to pay their bills. Interns in

the PaTH program will be paid as low as $4 per hour, cost employers nothing in wages and bring
in a wage subsidy of up to $10,000 to the employer, meaning that employers will be able to replace
minimum wage staff they already have, or were intending to hire, with workers that not only do not
cost anything, but which employers are paid to hire.
Activities in the programme are often mundane and do not increase employability; for example,
stacking shelves in supermarkets or picking up rubbish. Job seekers will not be covered by OH&S
legislation. Like ‘Work for the Dole’ participants, PaTH ‘interns’ are not covered by the Occupational
Health and Safety Acts in their state or entitled to worker’s compensation if something happens to
them on the job.26 Minister Cash has promised ‘safeguards’ that will prevent exploitation, but no
detail has been provided.
Recommendations

Scrap the PaTH scheme.
Reinvest in TAFE to restore it to its previous central position at the centre of vocational
education system.
A cap on contestably allocated funding (30%).
Increase funding to the CSIRO

Overseas temporary workers and unemployment
The ACTU has long been a staunch advocate for permanent migration. The current government
shows a complete disregard for our once treasured approach to nation building and instead, the
government has established a second tier of temporary migrant workers. Temporary visa holders
with some form of work rights numerically represent approximately one in ten of the Australian
labour force. As of January 2017 there were 1,525,730 temporary migrants, nearly all with some
level of working rights, including 148,500 WHM visas, 150,220 457 visa holders and as many as
55,000 people on 400 class visas.

Figure 7: visa with temporary working rights have been rising dramatically

While the ACTU recognises there is some need for some short term overseas workers where
genuine skills shortages exist, the exploitation of the former 457 and 400 visa classes has
highlighted how frequently these visas are used to avoid training Australians or paying decent
wages.
Examples include NSW’s Baird Government replacing full-time public service jobs with overseas
workers on temporary work visas27, the use of Chinese labourers paid $1.90 per hour to dismantle
the Mitsubishi plant in Adelaide Hills,28 the use of foreign workers on 400 visas on WA rigs paid
between US$3-8 per hour,29 and the number of overseas marine engineers employed on ships
despite the high number of domestically available workers available to carry out such work.30
The systematic underpayment of Indian IT workers shows just how badly the current temporary
work visa system increases inequality in Australia. The Australian Population Research Institute
found that IT professionals were the largest single occupation represented in the former 457
program and more than three-quarters are Indian nationals who mostly work in Sydney or
Melbourne. In 2015-2016 a quarter of these workers were being paid $53,900 or less per year,

far below the market rate for professionals, and roughly the same level as a starting salary for
young IT graduates.31
Study after study has shown the extent of vulnerability these workers experience. Beholden to their
employers for their continued stay in Australia, overseas workers are consistently exploited through
wage theft, exploitative hours, verbal and physical abuse. This was particularly highlighted in the
Senate inquiry into the impact of Australia's temporary work visa programs which culminated in
the report, A National Disgrace: The Exploitation of Temporary Work Visa Holders. The flawed
temporary migration system is prone to rorting, with half of the 46,000 400 class visas granted in
2016-17 being for “not specified” or “other services”, rather than for an official category of high
skill work.32
The reason this is so critical for regional inequality is that it helps fuel the massive inequality within
cities, where the majority of temporary migrants congregate. Temporary migrants are most
concentrated in the western suburbs of Sydney, and in Melbourne’s outer ring. In some of these
areas, more than half the residents were born overseas. This large number of frequently lower paid
temporary workers increases urban inequality both directly through their lower wages and by
depressing the wages of Australian long-term residents and citizens with whom they compete.33
In rural areas such as Outback Queensland, rural NSW and rural Victoria short term migrants,
typically on working holiday maker (WHM) visa holders, are prone to wide-spread exploitation. 66%
of WHM workers surveyed by Fair Work in 2016 felt employers took advantage of 417 visa holders
by underpaying them. This means that out of 148,000 WHM visa holders there is an army of over
98,000 underpaid workers being manipulated into undercutting local workers, increase local
unemployment and depress wages.
Recommendations:
1.

Ensure local workers get the opportunity to be trained and employed in secure jobs in their

local area.
2.

End massive exploitation of hyper insecure temporary visa workers by ensuring that these

workers are paid market rates and have their rights at work protected.
3.

Change our immigration program to favour permanent over temporary migration.

3. Income and wealth
The level of inequality is now at the worst it has been for 70 years35 with both income and wealth
inequality worsening at a rapid rate. Household incomes are currently lower in real terms than in
201136 The OECD reported that since 2004 “inclusiveness has been eroded. The Gini coefficient
has been drifting up and households in upper income brackets have benefited disproportionally
from Australia’s long period of economic growth.”.37
Over the decade 2004 – 2014 the lowest 20% of earners increased their wealth by just 4% while
the wealthiest quintile has increased their wealth by a staggering 38%.38 The wealth of the top ten
10% grew even faster with the richest 10% now owning 60 times the wealth of the poorest 10%.
Figure 8: increases in wealth and income, 2004-2014

The top 1% has seen an even more meteoric rise with the top 1% owning more than double
the wealth than that of the entire bottom 50% (see figure 9). This is an Americanisation of our
society.

Regional Inequality in Australia
Submission 88

Income inequality has similarly skewed toward the wealthy over this period. The OECD has raised
this as a significant issue for Australia to tackle. As Figure 8 shows, the lowest quintile has received
a far lower increase in income compared to the highest quintile throughout recent times. This
divergence is creating a country of haves and have nots, where residents of our wealthiest suburbs
are detach themselves from the rest of society.
Figure 10: inequality between areas

As figure 10 highlights, average incomes are generally higher in cities and mining areas. This
relates to the shifting patterns of work discussed above. However, these areas also contain the
highest rates of internal inequality – CBD areas and high-income suburbs to the east of

Melbourne and Adelaide and inner-north of Sydney are particularly unequal. Australia’s east
coast, and the southern half of Western Australia, are also less equal. This is due to the
stagnation of wages and the failure of the minimum wage to keep up with median wages. It is
also endemic of the top 10 and one per cent of earners pulling away from the rest.

Capital cities vs rest of states
The ratio of earnings between state capitals and the rest of the state has remained roughly at 1.2
over the past 20 years – citizens of state capitals have maintained a 20% premium.

However, the capital/rest of the state calculation disguises some significant intrastate
discrepancies. As noted in the introduction, by postcode Australia has some of the most
divergent incomes in the OECD. Point Piper residents recorded the highest average taxable
income of $192,500, while residents of Bulyeroi and Rowena in far-northeast NSW earned
an average of just $12,004.
Recommendations:
•
•
•

Increase the minimum wage by $50 per week
Remove tax loopholes to ensure that our millionaires pay their fair share of tax
Raise modern award minimum wages by 7.2%

4. Indigenous Australians
Indigenous Australians account for around 3% of the total population, but around 45% of the
population in rural and remote areas.40 This means that any discussion of regional inequality
requires a better understanding of inequality experienced by Indigenous Australians.
Income inequality has remained persistently high. During the Howard era, the gap between
Indigenous and non-Indigenous personal incomes declined sharply, only recovering to 1995 levels
in 2016. Currently Indigenous Australians earned on average 66 cents on the dollar of the median
gross income of their non-Indigenous counterparts. On the current trend, median gross income
parity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians will not be reached until 2060.

These figures disguise a more complex picture when geographic spread is taken into account.
While incomes of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians are slowly converging in our major
cities and regions, they are actually in decline relative to non-Indigenous citizens in remote and
very remote parts of the country as figure 14 shows.

Community Development Programme
The CDP is failing on all its core criteria. It is not generating employment, and is in fact replacing
existing job opportunities. It is creating work without the protections and rights which will workers
should be guaranteed. It is causing economic hardship in communities and in several cases has
been observed to be causing kids to go hungry.
According to The Australia Institute, less than 20% of CDP participants are supported into a job
and less than 10% stay in that job for six months. Based on current rates, a CDP participant will
wait 9.5 years in the scheme before being employed for 13 consecutive weeks.
In the 10th Closing the Gap report, released in February, the government confirmed that
extremely modest employment targets (halving the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous
unemployment on 2007 levels) set in 2007 would not be met this year.
Recommendations
1. The CDP should be scrapped. The model we support is the APONT model – the Remote
Development and Employment Scheme. The Scheme would create 10,500 part time jobs
to be filled by people who are currently involved in the CDP. The APONT model gives
communities the autonomy to decide what projects they want to invest in and how they
want to create employment.
2. Ensure adequate in-work and out of work welfare schemes for rural Australians.

3. Re-establish Indigenous welfare programme funding, and increase the level of
Indigenous users’ control over programme design and implementation.
